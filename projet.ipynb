We explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify peptide binding motifs for different MHC alleles. By training models on data from specific MHC Class I and II molecules, we demonstrate how 1-dimensional convolutional filters can effectively capture motifs and binding preferences. Our study introduces a method for extracting motif logos directly from the trained models, providing insights into how internal neural network representations align with known biological motifs. The results show significant alignment with experimental binding motifs, underscoring the utility of deep learning in immunological research and the potential for improving vaccine design and immunotherapy. | None | 2 | 0\n",

BioID defines the localization of thousands of endogenous proteins in human cells when used on hundreds of bait proteins. However, this high bait number restricts the approach9s usage and gives these datasets limited scalability for context-dependent spatial profiling. To make subcellular proteome mapping across different cell types and conditions more practical and cost-effective, we developed a comprehensive benchmarking platform and multiple metrics to assess how well a given bait subset can reproduce an original BioID dataset. We also introduce GENBAIT, which uses a genetic algorithm to optimize bait subset selection, to derive bait subsets predicted to retain the structure and coverage of two large BioID datasets using less than a third of the original baits. This flexible solution is poised to improve the intelligent selection of baits for contextual studies. | https://github.com/camlab-bioml/genbait_reproducibility, https://github.com/camlab-bioml/genbait | 1 | 1\n",

We present a computational pipeline for the discovery and design of therapeutic antibody candidates, which incorporates physics- and AI-based methods for the generation, assessment, and validation of developable candidate antibodies against diverse epitopes, via efficient few-shot experimental screens. We demonstrate that these orthogonal methods can lead to promising designs. We evaluated our approach by experimentally testing a small number of candidates against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in three different tasks: (i) traversing sequence landscapes of binders, we identify highly sequence dissimilar antibodies that retain binding to the Wuhan strain, (ii) rescuing binding from escape mutations, we show up to 54% of designs gain binding affinity to a new subvariant and (iii) improving developability characteristics of antibodies while retaining binding properties. These results together demonstrate an end-to-end antibody design pipeline with applicability across a wide range of antibody design tasks. We experimentally characterised binding against different antigen targets, developability profiles, and cryo-EM structures of designed antibodies. Our work demonstrates how combined AI and physics computational methods improve productivity and viability of antibody designs. | https://github.com/Exscientia/ab-characterisation | 1 | 1\n",

However, this is only possible when each cell comes from a different sample. As the number of cells in a droplet increases, the probability of two or more cells coming from the same sample increases rapidly. We show that the number of these unresolvable multiplets is greater than previously appreciated in the 10X Flex scRNA-seq protocol, and provide a formula for estimating the fraction of multiplets in a data set given a measured average droplet occupancy and number of unique samples in a pool. We also show that existing doublet detection tools should be applied to Flex data to identify these multiplets, and demonstrate that filtering out barcodes identified by these tools improves downstream analysis. | None | 2 | 0\n",

These phenotypes are heterogeneous, dependent on the cell type arrested and the insult inciting arrest. Because a universal biomarker for CS has yet to be identified, combinations of senescence-associated biomarkers linked to various biological stress responses including lysosomal activity (β-galactosidase staining), inflammation (senescence-associated secretory phenotypes, SASPs), and apoptosis (senescent cell anti-apoptotic pathways) are used to identify senescent cells.\n",
      "Using in vitro human bulk RNA-seq datasets, we find that senescent states enrich for various stress responses in a cell-type, temporal, and insult-dependent manner. We further demonstrate that various gene signatures used to identify senescent cells in the literature also enrich for stress responses, and are inadequate for universally and exclusively identifying senescent samples.\n",
      "Genes regulating stress responses - including transcription factors and genes controlling chromatin accessibility - are contextually differentially expressed, along with key enzymes involved in metabolism across arrest phenotypes. Additionally, significant numbers of SASP proteins can be predicted from senescent cell transcriptomes and also heterogeneously enrich for various stress responses in a context-dependent manner.\n",
      "We propose that 9senescence9 cannot be meaningfully defined due to the lack of underlying preserved biology across senescent states, and CS is instead a mosaic of stress-induced phenotypes regulated by various factors, including metabolism, TFs, and chromatin accessibility.

While current weakly supervised learning methods significantly reduce the need for extensive annotations and leverage large quantities of annotation-free whole-slide images (WSIs) to enhance classification robustness, they often fall short in segmentation accuracy. We attribute this limitation to the optimization goals in classification, which tend to focus solely on the most representative features-an approach that is particularly inefficient for WSIs with gigapixel resolution. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel approach based on streaming convolution, an end-to-end method for WSI training. Our contributions include the Rectified LogSumExp pooling method and adaptive pseudo annotation generation for self-training, both designed to encourage models to learn from sub-representative features. Using only slide-level annotations from the CAMELYON16 dataset, our method achieves a significant improvement in metastasis localization, with a recall from 49.85% to 71.33% at a precision of 90%. This conclusion also holds true for a 3,024-LN dataset used in the assessment of lung cancer lymph node metastasis with a recall improved from 28.31% to 50.82%. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Using a series of linked regressions, this analysis quantifies how complementary data relate to one another and respond to treatments.  Despite these advances, existing software9s rigid assumptions often result in users viewing mediation analysis as a black box.  We designed the multimedia R package to make advanced mediation analysis techniques accessible, ensuring that statistical components are interpretable and adaptable. The package provides a uniform interface to direct and indirect effect estimation, synthetic null hypothesis testing, bootstrap confidence interval construction, and sensitivity analysis, enabling experimentation with various mediator and outcome models while maintaining a simple overall workflow. The software includes modules for regularized linear, compositional, random forest, hierarchical, and hurdle modeling, making it well-suited to microbiome data. We illustrate the package through two case studies. The first re-analyzes a study of the microbiome and metabolome of Inflammatory Bowel Disease patients, uncovering potential mechanistic interactions between the microbiome and disease-associated metabolites, not found in the original study. The second analyzes new data about the influence of mindfulness practice on the microbiome. The mediation analysis highlights shifts in taxa previously associated with depression that cannot be explained indirectly by diet or sleep behaviors alone.

New sequencing technologies now enable the characterization of nucleotide and structural variations within species. Among them, TE polymorphism is critical to identify as it may influence species adaptation or trigger diseases. Despite the development of numerous bioinformatic programs, identifying the most effective tool is challenging due to non-overlapping results and varying efficiency across studies. Benchmarking efforts have highlighted the limitations of these tools, often evaluated on either real or simulated data. However, real data may be incomplete or contain unannotated TEs, while simulated data may not accurately reflect real genomes. This study introduces a simulation method generating data based on real genomes to control all genomic parameters. Evaluating several TE polymorphic detection tools using data from Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana, our study investigates factors like copy size, sequence divergence, and GC content that influence detection efficiency. Our results indicate that only a few programs perform satisfactorily and that all are sensitive to TE and genomic characteristics, that may differ according to the species considered. Using Bos taurus population data as a case study to identify polymorphic LTR-retrotransposon insertions, we found low-frequency insertions particularly challenging to detect due to a high number of false positives. Increased sequencing coverage improved sensitivity but reduced precision.

Despite its long reads, ONT has a higher error rate compared to other platforms, necessitating high-quality reference databases for accurate taxonomic assignments. However, the absence of targeted databases for underexplored habitats, such as the seafloor, limits ONT9s broader applicability for exploratory analysis. To address this, we have developed a strategy to build environmentally-targeted databases to enhance 16S rRNA gene(16S) analysis using ONT. We start by using Illumina short-read data to create a database of full-length or near full-length 16S sequences from seafloor samples. Initially, amplicons are mapped to the SILVA database, with matches added to our database. Unmatched amplicons are reconstructed using METASEED and Barrnap methodologies with amplicon and metagenome data. Finally, if the previous strategies did not succeed, we included the short-read sequences in the database. This resulted in AQUAeD-DB, which contains 14 545 16S sequences clustered at 95% identity. Comparative database analysis and relative abundance correlation studies reveal that AQUAeD-DB provides consistent results for both Illumina and Nanopore read assignments (median correlation coefficient: 0.50), whereas a standard database showed a substantially weaker correlation. These findings also emphasis its potential to recognize both high and low-abundance taxa, which could be key indicators in environmental studies. This work highlights the necessity of targeted databases for environmental analysis, especially for ONT-based studies, and lays foundations for future extension of the database. | https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap | 1 | 1\n",

To address the challenge of finding hidden connections within the growing volume of biomedical research, we developed a data science pipeline for efficient data extraction, transformation, and loading. Employing the CaseOLAP (Context-Aware Semantic Analytic Processing) algorithm, our pipeline quantifies interactions between 128 human cardiomyocyte Ca2+-regulating proteins and eight cardiovascular disease (CVD) categories. Our machine learning analysis of CaseOLAP scores reveals that the molecular interfaces of Ca2+-regulating proteins uniquely associate with cardiac arrhythmias and diseases of the cardiac conduction system, distinguishing them from other CVDs. Additionally, a knowledge graph analysis identified 59 of the 128 Ca2+-regulating proteins as involved in OS-related cardiac diseases, with cardiomyopathy emerging as the predominant category. By leveraging a link prediction algorithm, our research illuminates interactions between Ca2+-regulating proteins, OS, and CVDs. The insights gained from our study provide a deeper understanding of the molecular interplay between cardiac ROS and Ca2+-regulating proteins in the context of CVDs. Such understanding is essential for the innovation and development of targeted therapeutic strategies. | None | 2 | 0\n",

There have been increasing efforts dedicated to characterizing this complex and heterogeneous environment, including developing potential prognostic tools by leveraging modern deep learning methods. However, the identification of generalizable data-driven biomarkers has been limited, in part due to the inability to interpret the complex, black-box predictions made by these models. In this study, we introduce a data-driven yet interpretable approach for identifying patterns of cell organizations in the tumor microenvironment that are associated with patient prognoses. Our methodology relies on the construction of a bi-level graph model: (i) a cellular graph, which models the intricate tumor microenvironment, and (ii) a population graph that captures inter-patient similarities, given their respective cellular graphs, by means of a soft Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel. This systematic integration of information across different scales enables us to identify patient subgroups exhibiting unique prognoses while unveiling tumor microenvironment patterns that characterize them. We demonstrate our approach in a cohort of breast cancer patients and show that the identified tumor microenvironment patterns result in a risk stratification system that provides new complementary information with respect to standard stratification systems. Our results, which are validated in two independent cohorts, allow for new insights into the prognostic implications of the breast tumor microenvironment. This methodology could be applied to other cancer types more generally, providing insights into the cellular patterns of organization associated with different outcomes. | https://github.com/Sulam-Group/BiGraph4TME.git | 1 | 1\n",

Although they have shown ability to improve efficiency in engineering, it remains unclear if such models capture true biological patterns or artifacts of the training data. We aim to predict the circumstances in which pLMs can successfully perform zero-shot fitness estimation. Our work studies trends observed over hundreds of deep mutational scans across multiple different fitness objectives. We find that the likelihood, or abstractly, implicit preference of a certain protein sequence imbued during pretraining is predictive of fitness prediction capabilities. Both over-preferred and under-preferred wild type sequences harm performance. Using influence functions to causally understand how individual data points increase protein likelihoods, we find that there exists a power law tail due to sequence homology. Lastly, under-performance on low likelihood wild type proteins can be remedied by unsupervised finetuning. These findings that pLM zero-shot fitness estimation can be predicted by the likelihood of the engineered sequence can motivate and improve pLMs9 deployment in protein maturation campaigns. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Transcription is the primary determinate of cell-state and most cellular perturbations (e.g. disease, drug treatment, or abiotic stressors) impact transcription by altering the activity of polymerases. Thus, the ability to detect and quantify detailed changes in polymerase activity would yield considerable insight into most cellular processes. Nascent run-on sequencing assays provide a direct readout of polymerase activity, but no tools exist that comprehensively model this activity at genes.  Thus, we focus on RNA polymerase II (RNAP2), which is responsible for transcribing all protein-coding genes and many ncRNAs. Here we present the first model to fully capture the complete process of gene transcription by RNAP2.  For an individual gene, this model parameterizes each distinct stage of RNAP2 transcription---Loading, Initiation, Elongation, and Termination, hence LIET---in a biologically interpretable way, and combines them in a Bayesian mixture model intended to be applied to nascent run-on sequencing data. Additionally, we provide a user-friendly, open-source software implementation of the model, which we use to demonstrate its performance. With our improved modeling of Loading and Initiation we demonstrate that these processes are characteristically different between sense (gene coding) and antisense (PROMPT) strands. Furthermore, our model is the first to robustly quantify the Termination phase of transcription. By applying the LIET model to 24 different human cell-types, our analysis indicates that the position of dissociation appears to be highly consistent across cell-types, indicative of a highly regulated process. Furthermore, by applying the LIET model to perturbation experiments, we demonstrate its ability to detect specific regulatory changes in pausing ratio (at 59end), strand-bias, and dissociation location (at 39end). This opens the door to differential assessment of transcription regulation at the level of not only individual genes but also individual transcription stages within a gene. | None | 2 | 0\n",

However, the methylation state of a genomic region can also be characterized by a mixture of patterns (epialleles) with variable frequencies, and the relative proportions of such patterns can provide insights into its mechanisms of formation.\n",
      "Traditional methods based on bisulfite conversion and NGS, due to the read size (150 bp), allow epiallele frequency analysis only in high-CpG-density regions, limiting differential methylation studies to just 50% of the human methylome.

HLAIIPred is trained using a Transformer-based neural network and a dataset comprising of HLAII-presented peptides identified by mass spectrometry. In addition to predicting peptide presentation, the model can also provide important insights into peptide-HLAII interactions by identifying core peptide residues that form such interactions. We evaluate the performance of HLAIIPred on three different tasks, peptide presentation in monoallelic samples, immunogenicity prediction of therapeutic antibodies, and neoantigen prioritization for cancer immunotherapy. Additionally, we created a new dataset of biotherapeutics HLAII peptides presented by human dendritic cells. This data is used to develop screening strategies to predict the unwanted immunogenic segments of therapeutic antibodies by HLAII presentation models. HLAIIPred demonstrates superior or equivalent performance when compared to the latest models across all evaluated benchmark datasets. We achieve a 16% increase in prediction of presented peptides compared to the second-best model on a set of unseen peptides presented by less frequent alleles. The model also improves the area under the precision-recall curve by 3% for distinguishing between immunogenic and non-immunogenic antibodies.

Preventing future infectious outbreaks and developing efficient mitigation protocols can benefit from advanced computational modeling approaches. Here, we developed an agent-based modeling approach to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of an infection outbreak in a confined environment caused by a specific pathogen and to determine effective infection containment protocols. The approach integrates the 3D geographic information system of a confined environment, the behavior of the hosts, key biological parameters about the pathogen obtained from the experimental data, and the general mechanics of host-pathogen and pathogen-fomite interactions. To assess our approach, we applied it to the historical data of infectious outbreak caused by norovirus, H1N1 influenza A, and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. As a result our model was able to accurately predict the number of infections per day, correctly identify the day when the CDC vessel sanitation protocol would be triggered,  single out key biological parameters affecting the infection spread, and propose important changes to existing containment protocols, specific for different pathogens. This research not only contributes to our understanding of infection spread and containment in cruise ships but also offers insights applicable to other similar confined settings, such as nursing homes, schools, and hospitals. By providing a robust framework for real-time outbreak modeling, this study proposes new, more effective containment protocols and enhances our preparedness for managing infectious diseases and emerging pathogens in confined environments. | https://github.com/KorkinLab/infection-dynamics | 1 | 1\n",

In this study, we developed a Fully Hyperbolic Neural Network (FHNN) to embed functional brain connectivity graphs derived from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data into low dimensions on a Lorentz model of hyperbolic space. Using this model, we computed hyperbolic embeddings of the MEG brain networks of 587 individuals from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) dataset. Notably, we leveraged a unique metric - the radius of the node embeddings - which effectively captures the hierarchical organization of the brain, to characterize subtle hierarchical organizational changes in various brain subnetworks attributed to the aging process. Our findings revealed that a considerable number of subnetworks exhibited a reduction in hierarchy during aging, with some showing gradual changes and others undergoing rapid transformations in the elderly. Moreover, we demonstrated that hyperbolic features outperform traditional graph-theoretic measures in capturing age-related information in brain networks.

Ex-zd encompasses both a lossless compression method, which modestly outperforms all current methods for nanopore signal data compression, and a 9lossy9 method, which can be used to achieve dramatic additional savings. The latter component works by reducing the number of bits used to encode signal data. We show that the three least significant bits in signal data generated on instruments from Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) predominantly encode noise.

However, the impact of data curation on ML model performance is underexplored. As more sequence and structural data become available, a data-centric approach is increasingly favored over a model-centric method. A data-centric approach prioritizes high-quality, domain-specific data, ensuring ML tools are trained on datasets that accurately reflect biological complexity and diversity. This paper introduces a novel methodology that integrates ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) into ML models, enhancing data-centric strategies in the field. ASR uses computational techniques to infer ancient protein sequences from modern descendants, providing diverse, stable sequences with rich evolutionary information. While multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) are commonly used in protein engineering frameworks to incorporate evolutionary information, ASR offers deeper insights into protein evolution. Unlike MSAs, ASR captures mutation rates, phylogenic relationships, evolutionary trajectories, and specific ancestral sequences, giving access to novel protein sequences beyond what is available in public databases by natural selection. We employed two statistical methods for ASR: joint Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood. Bayesian approaches infer ancestral sequences by sampling from the entire posterior distribution, accounting for epistatic interactions between multiple amino acid positions to capture the nuances and uncertainties of ancestral sequences. In contrast, maximum likelihood methods estimate the most probable amino acids at individual positions in isolation. Both methods provide extensive ancestral data, enhancing ML model performance in protein sequence generation and fitness prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that generative ML models training on either Bayesian or maximum likelihood approaches produce highly stable and diverse protein sequences. We also fine-tuned the evolutionary scale ESM protein language model with reconstructed ancestral data to obtain evolutionary-driven protein representations, and downstream stability prediction tasks for Endolysin and Lysozyme C families. For Lysozyme C, ancestral-based representations outperformed the baseline ESM in KNN classification and matched the established InterPro method. In Endolysin, our novel ASR-Dist method performed on par with or better than the baseline and other fine-tuning approaches across various classification metrics. ASR-Dist showed consistent performance in both simple and complex classification models, suggesting the effectiveness of this data-centric approach in enhancing protein representations. This work demonstrates how evolutionary data can improve ML-driven protein engineering, presenting a novel data-centric approach that expands our exploration of protein sequence space and enhances our ability to predict and design functional proteins. | https://github.com/WoldringLabMSU/EvoSeq-ML | 1 | 1\n",

However, their performance can vary depending on molecular and clinical contexts, complicating variant classification. Aim: This study aims to assess the performance variability of commonly used VEP tools under different conditions. Additionally, the study aims to recalibrate score thresholds to better reflect evidence of pathogenicity. Methods: ClinVar variants classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP), benign (B), or likely benign (LB) were analyzed using 25 VEP tools. Tools were evaluated based on discriminatory performance. Data were stratified by variant creation date, allele frequency, conservation level, mode of inheritance (MOI), and disease category. For each subset, Bayesian methods were employed to recalibrate score thresholds corresponding to the levels of evidence defined by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG). Results: The performance of VEP tools varied significantly across different subsets. Variants created after 2020 showed a mild yet significant decrease in the performance of certain VEP tools, particularly those trained on earlier datasets. VEP tools exhibited reduced accuracy for variants with higher allele frequencies, particularly those exceeding a frequency of 10-4, suggesting a need for recalibration when assessing more common variants. Tools demonstrated lower discriminatory performance for variants located in regions with high conservation, mostly due to a decrease in specificity. Variants affecting autosomal recessive (AR) and X-linked (XL) genes were more accurately classified compared to those affecting autosomal dominant (AD) genes by most tools. Differences in MOI and conservation levels within certain disease categories were shown to correlate with overall performance. Recalibration of prediction scores resulted in lower score thresholds in low conservation regions compared to high and uncovered subsets in which higher levels of evidence may be achieved.

However, many SRT platforms lack single-cell resolution, necessitating cell-type deconvolution methods to estimate cell-type proportions in SRT spots. Despite advancements in existing tools, these methods have not addressed biases occurring at three scales: individual spots, entire tissue samples, and discrepancies between SRT and reference scRNA-seq datasets. These biases result in overbalanced cell-type proportions for each spot, mismatched cell-type fractions at the sample level, and data distribution shifts across platforms.

We present RAPDOR, a tool for intuitive analyzing and visualizing such datasets, based on the Jensen-Shannon distance and subsequent analysis of similarities between replicates, applied to three datasets. First, we examined the in-gradient distribution profiles of protein complexes with or without RNase treatment (GradR) to identify the set of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. RBPs play pivotal regulatory and structural roles; although numerous RBPs have been identified, the complete set is unknown for any species. RAPDOR identified 80 potential RBPs, including ribosomal proteins, likely RNA-modifying enzymes, and several proteins not previously associated with RNA binding. High-ranking putative RBPs, such as the universal stress protein Sll1388, or the translation inhibitor LrtA/RaiA, were predicted by RAPDOR but not the TriPepSVM algorithm, indicating uncharacterized RBP domains. These data are available online at https://synecho-rapdor.biologie.uni-freiburg.de, providing a comprehensive resource for RNase-sensitive protein complexes in cyanobacteria. We then show by reanalyzing existing datasets, that RAPDOR is effective in examining the intracellular redistribution of proteins under stress conditions. RAPDOR is a generic, non-parametric tool for the intuitive and versatile analysis of highly complex data sets such as the study of protein distributions using fractionation protocols. | None | 2 | 0\n",

However, ancient bone samples generate sparse datasets containing only a few collagen proteins, rendering target-decoy strategies unusable and increasing uncertainty in peptide annotation. ClassiCOL embraces and even extends this ambiguity using a novel isoBLAST approach. The exhaustive set of potential peptide candidates created in this way is then used to retain or reject different potential paths at each taxonomic branching point down to the taxonomic level attainable with the sample information, always allowing for potential mixtures in the process. As an end point, all considered ambiguity is graphically represented with a clear prioritization of the species in the sample. Using public as well as in-house data, we demonstrate the performance of this universal postprocessing approach on different instruments and explore the possibility of identifying genetic as well as sample mixtures.

In spite of extensive efforts, known genetic mutations can hardly explain the ASD cases, which signifies the highly heterogeneous nature of ASDs and calls for shifting to a more holistic approach for understanding the mechanism of these disorders. Several studies have reported that a wide range of metabolic markers is present in blood, urine and brain samples of ASD patients. In this study, using transcriptome data of neurons derived from ASD and control individuals, we reconstructed neuron-specific metabolic network models for two neurodevelopmental time points representing late neural progenitor stage and mature neurons. We simulate gene inactivation in these networks to investigate the altered metabolic fluxes and biological pathways in ASD metabolism. We further examine these networks using reporter metabolite analysis to identify those metabolites around which significant gene expression changes occur. Briefly, our model was successful in predicting previously reported metabolites and pathways implicated in ASD metabolism, including oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, and points to a new finding concerning alterations in the less studied pathways like keratan sulfate degradation pathway and N/O-glycosylation in ASD. Finally, by employing the robust metabolic transformation algorithm (rMTA) we set to find potential drug targets that can reverse the ASD metabolic state into a healthy one. Interestingly, our model found phosphatidic phosphatase enzyme, as well as phosphatidylethaolamine and phosphatidylserine transfer proteins as targets that could recover the healthy metabolic state. | None | 2 | 0\n",

They can function as both tumor suppressors and oncogenes depending on the specific miRNA and its target genes. Detecting miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) is critical for unraveling the complex mechanisms of gene regulation and promising towards RNA therapy for cancer. There is currently a lack of MTIs prediction methods that simultaneously perform feature learning from heterogeneous gene regulatory network (GRN) and genomic sequences. To improve the prediction performance of MTIs, we present a novel transformer-based multi-view feature learning method -- MiRGraph, which consists of two main modules for learning the sequence-based and GRN-based feature embedding. For the former, we utilize the mature miRNA sequences and the complete 39UTR sequence of the target mRNAs to encode sequence features using a hybrid transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN) (TransCNN) architecture. For the latter, we utilize a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) module to extract the relational and structural information from the GRN consisting of miRNA-miRNA, gene-gene and miRNA-target interactions. The TransCNN and HGT modules can be learned end-to-end to predict experimentally validated MTIs from MiRTarBase. MiRGraph outperforms  existing methods in not only recapitulating the true MTIs but also in predicting strength of the MTIs based on the in-vitro measurements of miRNA transfections.

In response to this limitation, we introduce IgBlend, which integrates both the 3D coordinates of backbone atoms (C-alpha, N, and C) and antibody sequences. Our model is trained on a diverse dataset containing over 4 million unique structures and more than 200 million unique sequences, including heavy and light chains as well as nanobodies. We rigorously evaluate IgBlend using established benchmarks such as sequence recovery, complementarity-determining region (CDR) editing and inverse folding and demonstrate that IgBlend consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art models across all benchmarks.

Masked autoregressive flows, a deep learning technique, is also tested as an alternative do MGM models. The method is compared to that of approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) with random forests, with which it shares some technical features, on scenarios of inference of historical demography from population genetic data. These comparisons highlight the importance of an iterative workflow for exploring the parameter space efficiently.

Large-scale atlas programs such as Human Tumor Atlas Network and are relying heavily on highly-multiplexed approaches including CyCIF and CODEX to image up to 100 antigens. Such high dimensionality allows a deep understanding of cellular diversity and spatial structure, but can provide a challenge for image visualization and exploration. One challenge for data portals and visualization tools is the generation of an informative and pleasing image preview that captures the full heterogeneity of the image, rather than relying on a multi-channel overlay that may be restricted to 4-6 channels. We describe Miniature, a tool to automatically generate informative image thumbnails from multiplexed tissue images in an unsupervised and scalable manner. Miniature aims to aid researchers in understanding tissue heterogeneity and identifying potential pathological features without extensive manual intervention. Miniature uses a choice of unsupervised dimensionality reduction methods including uniform manifold embedding and projection (UMAP), t-distributed stochastic neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), and principal Component analysis (PCA) to reduce on-tissue pixels from a low-resolution, high dimensional image to two or three dimensions. Pixels are then color encoded by their coordinate in low dimensional space using a choice of color maps. We show that perceptually distinct regions in Miniature thumbnails reflect known pathological features seen in both the source multiplexed tissue image and H&E imaging of the same sample. We evaluate Miniature parameters for dimensionality reduction and pixel color encoding to recommend default configurations that maximize perceptual trustworthiness to both the low-dimensional embedding and high-dimensional image and provide high Mantel correlation between the perceived color difference (delta E 2000) and distance in high- and low-dimensional space. By simulating color vision deficiency, we show that Miniature thumbnails are accessible to all.

Transcription factors, which are proteins binding to regulatory DNA regions (open chromatin regions), are key regulators of gene expression thereby orchestrating cellular differentiation processes. Dissecting these key regulatory events will help to develop protocols for cellular reprogramming or ex vivo differentiation in e.g. organoids and to understand disease-related differentiation processes for potential therapeutic interventions. In this context, a unique resource to understand the interplay between chromatin, regulatory signals (transcription factor binding), and expression changes during cellular differentiation, is multi-modal single-cell sequencing, which can measure both full expression programs and genome-wide open chromatin.

Methods: The main active compounds and their corresponding targets were obtained from PubChem, SwissTargetprediction, GeneCards, PharmMapper and TCMSP databases. Targets related to CPF were screened from GeneCards, OMIM, DisGeNET and TTD databases. The common \"QIENUO-CPF\" targets were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) through the website of Weishengxin. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and compound-target-pathway network were constructed by Cytoscape, and the network parameters were systematically analyzed. The interaction between core protein and monomer components was evaluated and verified by molecular docking method. Results: 228 active compounds target and 1354 CPF-related targets were screened out, and 92 common targets were analyzed by GO and KEGG. The results showed that the therapeutic effect of QIENUO on CPF was mainly through AMPK signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway and TGF-β signaling pathway. The results of molecular docking show that the binding energy of 9 of 15 pairs of ligand-receptor pairs is lower than-6 kjmol-1.

This suggests that many valuable proteins, potentially catalyzing novel enzymatic reactions, remain undiscovered among the vast number of function-unknown proteins. In this study, we developed a method to predict whether two proteins catalyze the same enzymatic reaction by analyzing sequence and structural similarities, utilizing structural models predicted by AlphaFold2. We performed pocket detection and domain decomposition for each structural model. The similarity between protein pairs was assessed using features such as full-length sequence similarity, domain structural similarity, and pocket similarity. We developed several models using conventional machine learning algorithms and found that the LightGBM-based model outperformed the models. Our method also surpassed existing approaches, including those based solely on full-length sequence similarity and state-of-the-art deep learning models. Feature importance analysis revealed that domain sequence identity, calculated through structural alignment, had the greatest influence on the prediction.

T-cell epitope recognition is mediated by the binding of the T-Cell Receptor (TCR) and TCRs recognizing clinically relevant epitopes are promising for T-cell based therapies. Starting from one of the few known TCRs targeting the cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1 157-165 epitope, we built large phage display libraries of TCRs with randomized Complementary Determining Region 3 of the β chain. The TCR libraries were panned against the NY-ESO-1 epitope, which enabled us to collect thousands of epitope-specific TCR sequences. We then trained a machine learning TCR-epitope interaction predictor with this data and could identify several epitope-specific TCRs directly from TCR repertoires. Cellular binding and functional assays revealed that the predicted TCRs displayed activity towards the NY-ESO-1 epitope and no detectable cross-reactivity with self-peptides.

Traditionally they are identified from large DNA/RNA libraries using in vitro methods, like Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX). However, these libraries capture only a small fraction of theoretical sequence space, and various aptamer candidates are constrained by actual sequencing capabilities from the experiment. Addressing this, we proposed AptaDiff, the first in silico aptamer design and optimization method based on the diffusion model. Our Aptadiff can generate aptamers beyond the constraints of high-throughput sequencing data, leveraging motif-dependent latent embeddings from variational autoencoder, and can optimize aptamers by affinity-guided aptamer generation according to Bayesian optimization. Comparative evaluations revealed AptaDiff9s superiority over existing aptamer generation methods in terms of quality and fidelity across four high-throughput screening data targeting distinct proteins. Moreover, Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments were conducted to validate the binding affinity of aptamers generated through Bayesian optimization for two target proteins. The results unveiled a significant boost of 87.9% and 60.2% in RU values, along with a 3.6-fold and 2.4-fold decrease in KD values for the respective target proteins. Notably, the optimized aptamers demonstrated superior binding affinity compared to top experimental candidates selected through SELEX, underscoring the promising outcomes of our AptaDiff in accelerating the discovery of superior aptamers. | https://github.com/wz-create/AptaDiff, http://github.com/SheffieldML/ | 1 | 1\n",

Impurity correction factors can be applied to labels mixing C- and N-type reporter ions, such as TMT Pro. Application to a single-cell multi-species mixture benchmark shows high accuracy of the impurity-corrected results. TMT data recorded with FAIMS separation can be analyzed directly in MaxQuant without splitting the raw data into separate files per FAIMS voltage. Weighted median normalization, is applied to several datasets, including large-scale human body atlas data. In the benchmark datasets the weighted median normalization either removes or strongly reduces the batch effects between different TMT plexes and results in clustering by biology. In datasets including a reference channel, we find that weighted median normalization performs as well or better when the reference channel is ignored and only the sample channel intensities are used, suggesting that the measurement of a reference channel is unnecessary when using weighted median normalization in MaxQuant. We demonstrate that MaxQuant including the weighted median normalization performs well on multi-notch MS3 data, as well as on phosphorylation data.

However, IMS experiments tend to yield large datasets, routinely recording over 200,000 ion intensity values per mass spectrum and more than 100,000 pixels, i.e., spectra, per dataset. Traditionally, IMS data size challenges have been addressed by feature selection or extraction, such as by peak picking and peak integration. Selective data reduction techniques such as peak picking only retain certain parts of a mass spectrum, and often these describe only medium-to-high-abundance species. Since lower-intensity peaks and, for example, near-isobar species are sometimes missed, selective methods can potentially bias downstream analysis towards a subset of species in the data rather than considering all species measured. Results: We present an alternative to selective data reduction of IMS data that achieves similar data size reduction while better conserving the ion intensity profiles across all recorded m/z-bins, thereby preserving full spectrum information. Our method utilizes a low-rank matrix completion model combined with a randomized sparse-format-aware algorithm to approximate IMS datasets. This representation offers reduced dimensionality and a data footprint comparable to peak picking, but also retains complete spectral profiles, enabling comprehensive analysis and compression. We demonstrate improved preservation of lower signal-to-noise-ratio signals and near-isobars, mitigation of selection bias, and reduced information loss compared to current state-of-the art data reduction methods in IMS. | https://github.com/vandeplaslab/full_profile | 1 | 1\n",

Wet lab studies are often performed to understand such interactions but are limited by cost and time. However, the biochemical data generated can be explored to compute unknown interactions. Here, we developed a computational model named UniGEN-DDI (Unified Graph Embedding Network for Drug-Drug Interaction) for the estimation of interactions between drugs.

LRR proteins form large paralogous families, with nearly 400 in the human genome alone, all sharing similar semi-regular solenoid-like structures. Despite this structural similarity, they exhibit remarkable diversity in binding specificity. For TLR receptors, this includes a range of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), while other LRR proteins bind an extensive array of ligands, including proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules. The LRR domains contain repeats that have similar, yet not identical, 3D structures and patterns of conserved residues. Through in-depth analysis of sequence and structural conservation in individual repeats of human TLRs, we demonstrate that even subtle variations between these repeats alter the local solenoid structure, leading to significant functional changes. Variations in repeat length and defining patterns result in local changes in curvature and the emergence of structural features such as loops, cavities, or specific interaction interfaces. Understanding how divergence in LRR repeats influences their functional roles can provide deeper insights into their binding mechanisms, including interactions with unknown ligands, both in humans and across the diverse phylogenetic spectrum of animals that rely on their TLR repertoires for immune activation. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Identifying the specific residues where proteins bind to DNA is of paramount importance, as it enables the modeling of their interactions and facilitates downstream studies. Nevertheless, the development of accurate and efficient computational methods for this task remains a persistent challenge. Accurate prediction of protein-DNA binding sites has far-reaching implications for understanding molecular mechanisms, disease processes, drug discovery, and synthetic biology applications. It helps bridge the gap between genomics and functional biology, enabling researchers to uncover the intricacies of cellular processes and advance our knowledge of the biological world. The method used to predict DNA binding residues in this study is a potent combination of conventional bioinformatics tools, protein language models, and cutting-edge machine learning and deep learning classifiers. On a dataset of protein-DNA binding sites, our model is meticulously trained, and it is then rigorously examined using several experiments.

Thus, significance of eRBC parameters in identifying iron deficiency associated thrombocytosis was also examined in this cohort. Methods: Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes from consenting donors for analyses of routine haematological and eRBC parameters. Serum samples were isolated for estimation of iron parameters. Results: Iron deficient donors had significantly altered eRBC parameters. Among them, Ret-He with a cut-off of ≥32 pg had high AUC (0.822) and showed relatively high sensitivity & specificity in detecting iron deficiency. Combination of Ret-He with CCI increased sensitivity & specificity to 90.6% and 98.2%, in detection of donors affected with iron restricted erythropoiesis. This cohort had increased platelet counts, which showed significant association with Ret-He (β= -0.373), RBC-He (β= -0.384), CCI (β= 0.384), Hypo-He (β=0.494) and Micro-R (β= 0.299). Elevated platelet counts also showed significant correlations with these eRBC parameters, which was absent in iron replete donors. Conclusions: eRBC parameters are sensitive indicators of non-anaemic iron deficiency, which may be enhanced by combining them. Their significant association with elevated platelet counts in iron deficient donors, highlights their importance in reflecting iron deficiency associated thrombocytosis. | None | 2 | 0\n",

It is challenging to use this information for analysis of distribution and trends. The lack of a protocol leads to bias in observations and therefore data are not representative. The bias is a consequence of unequal detection probabilities, caused by different preferences and habits of citizen scientists. METHODS: We propose to incorporate characteristics of these excursions in analyses of data collected by citizen scientists to improve estimates of the probability that a species is not detected and reported, even though it does occur. By limiting these models to areas that are known to be occupied, detection can be modeled separately without considering variation in occupancy. We apply this idea to 150 common species in the Southwest Delta of The Netherlands, and illustrate the data selection, the modeling process and the results using four species. RESULTS: The strongest features to predict detection are the number of species during a visit (list length), earlier observations of the target species by the same observer, and the day of year. We compare three approaches to predict the total non-detection probability that takes all visits to an area into account. Predictions based on only the number of visits were outperformed by predictions that also take the list length into account. Our predictions based on all features combined consistently beat both other approaches, across all 10 species groups that were compared. DISCUSSION: We thus show that explicitly modelling the characteristics of all visits to an occupied area results in estimation of non-detection probabilities, while providing insight into the causes of detection and reporting bias. Furthermore, predictions of our model provide a basis for quantifying the sampling effort in each area, which is a promising first step to correct bias in citizen science data when aiming to map a species′ distribution. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Addressing this issue is crucial for leveraging machine learning in scientific discovery, where models must generalize to new molecules or materials. Current methods typically split data into train and test sets using various criteria, like temporal, sequence identity, scaffold, or random cross-validation; before evaluating model performance. However, with so many splitting criteria available, existing approaches offer limited guidance on selecting the most appropriate one, and they do not provide mechanisms for incorporating prior knowledge about the target deployment distribution(s). To tackle this problem, we have developed a novel metric, AU-GOOD, which quantifies expected model performance under conditions of increasing dissimilarity between train and test sets, while also accounting for prior knowledge about the target deployment distribution(s), when available. This metric is broadly applicable to biochemical entities, including proteins, small molecules, nucleic acids, or cells; as long as a relevant similarity function is defined for them. Recognizing the wide range of similarity functions used in biochemistry, we propose criteria to guide the selection of the most appropriate metric for partitioning. We also introduce a new partitioning algorithm that generates more challenging test sets, and we propose statistical methods for comparing models based on AU-GOOD. Finally, we demonstrate the insights that can be gained from this framework by applying it to two different use cases: developing predictors for pharmaceutical properties of small molecules, and using protein language models as embeddings to build biophysical property predictors.

Moreover, we are not supposed to seek common structures in the smaller bin sizes than optimal bin sizes if we cannot suppress the appearance of phase transition-like phenomena even after increasing the number of mapped short reads per bins, since it might mean that there are no common structures any more in finer resolutions and individual Hi-C datasets might have to be analyzed separately. Thus, quality assessments of individual datasets have the limited ability to determine the best bin size common for all datasets. In this study, we propose, the first-ever to our knowledge, a novel adoption of tensor decomposition (TD) based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) to choose the optimal bin sizes for the integration of multiple Hi-C datasets. The use of TD-based unsupervised FE can exhibit something like phase-transition phenomena, by which we can automatically estimate the possible smallest bin size (or the highest resolution) empirically without manually setting some threshold value by hand for the integration of multiple Hi-C datasets. | https://github.com/tagtag/TDbasedUFEHiC | 1 | 1\n",

Such methods are enticing because they promise to answer pressing questions in fields ranging from developmental genetics to cell fate engineering and because they are a fast, cheap, and accessible complement to the corresponding experiments. However, the absolute and relative accuracy of these methods is poorly characterized, limiting their informed use, their improvement, and the interpretation of their predictions. To address these issues, we created a benchmarking platform that combines a panel of 11 large-scale perturbation datasets with an expression forecasting software engine that encompasses or interfaces to a wide variety of methods. We used our platform to systematically assess methods, parameters, and sources of auxiliary data, finding that performance strongly depends on the choice of metric, and especially for simple metrics like mean squared error, it is uncommon for expression forecasting methods to out-perform simple baselines. Our platform will serve as a resource to improve methods and to identify contexts in which expression forecasting can succeed. | https://github.com/ekernf01/perturbation_benchmarking | 1 | 0\n",

This complexity makes it difficult to assess the full impact of a drug solely based on individual knowledgebases. We make the impact more comprehensible through the characterization of drug targetability in terms of a combination of biochemical pathway data from the Reactome Knowledgebase and drug-target interaction data from the Cancer Targetome. This leads to a graphical representation of drug targetability. We further improve comprehensibility by developing metrics to quantify the graph structures in order to evaluate drug target specificity and navigate the hierarchical nature of biological networks and identify candidate treatment options to increase specificity and minimize off-target effects.

To see whether current models already reach this goal, we benchmarked two state-of-the-art foundation models and one popular graph-based deep learning framework against deliberately simplistic linear models in two important use cases: For combinatorial perturbations of two genes for which only data for the individual single perturbations have been seen, we find that a simple additive model outperformed the deep learning-based approaches. Also, for perturbations of genes that have not yet been seen, but which may be \"interpolated\" from biological similarity or network context, a simple linear model performed as good as the deep learning-based approaches. While the promise of deep neural networks for the representation of biological systems and prediction of experimental outcomes is plausible, our work highlights the need for critical benchmarking to direct research efforts that aim to bring transfer learning to biology. | None | 2 | 0\n",

However, the false negative rate of NIPT algorithms has not been thoroughly evaluated due to the lack of positive samples. In this study, we present an efficient computational approach to create positive samples with autosomal trisomy from negative samples. We applied the approach to establish a low coverage dataset of 1440 positive samples with T13, T18, and T21 aberrations for both mosaic and non-mosaic conditions. We examined the performance of WisecondorX and its improvement, called VINIPT, on both negative and positive datasets. Experiments showed that WisecondorX and VINIPT with a z-score threshold of 3.3 were able to detect all non-mosaic samples with T13, T18, and T21 aberrations (i.e., the sensitivity of 100%). Using a lower z-score threshold of 2.58 when analyzing mosaic samples, both WisecondorX and VINIPT have the overall sensitivity of 99.7% on detecting T13, T18, and T21 aberrations from mosaic samples. WisecondorX has the specificity of 98.5% for the non-mosaic analysis, but a considerably lower specificity of 95% for the mosaic analysis. VINIPT has a much better specificity than WisecondorX, i.e., 99.9% for the non-mosaic analysis, and 98.2% for the mosaic analysis.  The results suggest that VINIPT can play as a powerful NIPT tool for the low coverage data. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Typical workflows involve generation of a mutagenized variant library, screening/selection of variants based on phenotypic fitness, and comprehensive analysis of binned variant populations by NGS. However, in such cases, the HTS data are subject to interval censoring, where each fitness value is calculated based on the assignment of variants to bins. Such censoring leads to increased uncertainty, which can impact data accuracy and, consequently, the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms tasked with predicting sequence-fitness pairings. Here, we investigated the impact of interval censoring on data quality and ML performance in biological HTS experiments. We theoretically analyzed the impact of data censoring and propose a dimensionless number, theRatio of Discretization(RD), to assist in optimizing HTS parameters such as the bin width and the sampling size. This approach can be used to minimize errors in fitness prediction by ML and to improve the reliability of these methods. These findings are not limited to biological HTS techniques and can be applied to other systems where interval censoring is an advantageous measurement strategy. | None | 2 | 0\n",

However, it only provides a readout on mixtures of cells, potentially occulting important information on clinically relevant cell subtypes. To address this shortcoming, we developed a machine-learning framework to decompose drug sensitivity recorded at the bulk level into cell subtype-specific drug sensitivity. We first determined that our method could decipher the cellular composition of bulk samples with top-ranking accuracy across five cancer types compared to state-of-the-art bulk deconvolution methods. We emphasize its effectiveness in the realm of Acute Myeloid Leukemia, where it appears to offer the most precise estimation of leukemic stem cell fractions across three test datasets and three patient cohorts. We then optimized an algorithm capable of estimating cell subtype- and single-cell-specific drug sensitivity, which we evaluated by performing in-vitro drug studies and in-depth simulations. We then applied our deconvolution strategy to the beatAML cohort dataset, currently the most extensive database of ex-vivo drug screening data. We developed a drug sensitivity profile tailored to specific cell subtypes, focusing on four therapeutic compounds predicted to target leukemic stem cells: the previously known midostaurin and A-674563, as well as SNS-032 and foretinib, which have not been previously linked to leukemic stem cells.

Here, we identified GRNs by integrating gene expression (GE) and chromatin accessibility data derived from functionally defined cell populations enriched for HSC and LSC. We analyzed n=32 LSC+ and n=32 LSC- cell fractions from n=22 AML patients, along with n=7 stem and n=10 progenitor enriched cell populations sorted from human umbilical cord blood (hUCB), producing a database of n≈17,000 transcription factor (TF) regulatory interactions for hUCB-HSPC and AML. We developed an iterative algorithm that associates the degree of chromatin openness with TF binding preferences, and the GE of candidate TF and target genes within 100kb upstream of transcription start sites. A putative regulatory structure was found to be enriched in HSC-enriched cell populations, comprising TF-target gene interactions between ETS1, EGR1, RUNX2, and ZNF683 oriented in a self-reinforcing configuration. A regulatory loop comprising FOXK1 and MEIS1, rather than the 4-factor HSC subnetwork, was detected in the LSC-specific GRN. The core HSC and LSC TF networks were extended using protein-protein interaction (PPI) data to determine connectivity with interacting genes whose expression strongly associated with LSC/HSC frequency estimates, producing a database of n=103,516 PPI target pathways. The effect of perturbing genes along the identified pathways on functional HSC and LSC frequency was predicted based on statistical regression analyses. To validate GRN predictions, we used pharmacologic and CRISPR targeting, in addition to re-examining published functional data associated with several network nodes that were predicted to impact stemness. Notably, we found that inhibition of CDK6 in AML samples markedly reduced LSC numbers as assessed in de novo serial xenotransplantation studies (fold change ≈ 10), as predicted by the LSC GRN model. Additionally, in-house CRISPR-based knockdown of ETS1 resulted in a significant decrease in HSC quiescence-associated microRNA-126 expression, and increased HSC frequency. Taken together, our models provide a comprehensive view of the underlying regulatory structures governing functional human HSC and LSC. This approach has translational potential as it can be used as a high-throughput in-silico screening tool for the systematic identification of gene targets for LSC elimination and HSC expansion. | None | 2 | 0\n",

While LLMs primarily focus on next token/word prediction, we apply this principle to molecular design by reframing the task as predicting the next token/fragment. We present FragLlama, a large language model trained for molecular design, featuring custom tokens that represent molecular fragments and functional groups. The model is for generating molecules given one or two fragments, for application scenarios like general hit-to-lead and lead optimization stage drug design, PROTAC linker design; mapping to commonly used drug design strategies like fragment growing and scaffold hopping. In the pre-training stage, we adapted the Llama 3 architecture to create FragLlama, training it to learn conditional probabilities of these fragment-level tokens. The subsequent alignment stage employed fine-tuning to guide the model towards generating molecules with desired properties. The effectiveness of FragLlama is demonstrated through its applications in designing molecular glue libraries, PROTAC linkers and EGFR binders.

I replicate the results presented by Zhong et al. for interaction structures with one, two, three, and four arcs ablated from the dominance network. I then empirically demonstrate that the dynamics of the RPSLS ESCG have sufficiently long time constants that the true asymptotic outcomes can often only be identified after running the ablated ESCG for 10,000,000 MCS or longer, and that the true long-term outcomes can be markedly less diverse than those reported by Zhong et al. as asymptotic.  Finally I demonstrate that, when run for sufficiently many MCS, the original unablated RPSLS system exhibits essentially the same asymptotic outcomes as the ablated RPSLS systems, and in this sense the only causal effect of the ablations is to alter the time required for the system to converge to the long-term asymptotic states that the unablated system eventually settles to anyhow. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Different from prior works, our model directly learns on the frequency domain, harnessing its resilience to noise and uneven brightness, which common artifacts found in medical images. By focusing on low-frequency image components, we significantly reduce computational complexity while preserving essential image features. Our deep learning architecture extracts discriminative features directly from the Fourier domain, leading to improved segmentation accuracy and robustness compared to traditional spatial domain methods. Additionally, we propose a new benchmark incorporating various levels of Gaussian noise to assess susceptibility to noise attacks.

To address the latter, Zhang and Mirarab (2022) leverage gene tree branch lengths and support values to weight quartets within the popular summary method ASTRAL. Although these quartet weighting schemes improved the robustness of ASTRAL to gene tree estimation error, implementing the weighting schemes presented computational challenges, resulting in the authors abandoning ASTRAL9s original search algorithm (i.e., computing an exact solution within a constrained search space) in favor of search heuristics (i.e., hill climbing with nearest neighbor interchange moves from a starting tree constructed via randomized taxon addition). Here, we show that these quartet weighting schemes can be leveraged within the Quartet Max Cut framework of Snir and Rao (2010), with only a small increase in time complexity compared to the unweighted algorithm, which behaves more like a constant factor in our simulation study. Moreover, our new algorithm, implemented within the TREE-QMC software, was highly competitive with weighted ASTRAL, even outperforming it in terms of species tree accuracy on some challenging model conditions, such as large numbers of taxa. In comparing unweighted and weighted summary methods on two avian data sets, we found that weighting quartets by gene tree branch lengths improves their robustness to \\textit{systematic} homology errors and is as effective as removing the impacted taxa from individual gene trees or removing the impacted gene trees entirely. Lastly, our study revealed that TREE-QMC is highly robust to high rates of missing data and is promising as a supertree method.

During the development of cancer cells, mitochondria influence various cell death patterns by regulating metabolic pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation. However, the relationship between mitochondrial function and cell death patterns in HCC remains unclear. In this study, we used a comprehensive machine learning framework to construct a mitochondrial functional activity-associated programmed cell death index (MPCDI) based on scRNA-seq and RNA-seq data from TCGA, GEO, and ICGC datasets. The index signature was used to classify HCC patients, and studied the multi-omics features, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity of the subtypes. Finally, we constructed the MPCDI signature consisting of four genes (S100A9, FYN, LGALS3, and HMOX1), which was one of the independent risk factors for the prognosis of HCC patients. The HCC patients were divided into high- and low-MPCDI groups, and the immune status was different between the two groups. Patients with high MPCDI had higher TIDE scores and poorer responses to immunotherapy, suggesting that high-MPCDI patients might not be suitable for immunotherapy. By analyzing the drug sensitivity data of CTRP, GDSC, and PRISM databases, it was found that staurosporine has potential therapeutic significance for patients with high MPCDI. In summary, based on the characteristics of mitochondria function and PCD patterns, we used single-cell and transcriptome data to identify four genes and construct the MPCDI signature, which provided new perspectives and directions for the clinical diagnosis and personalized treatment of HCC patients. | https://github.com/wanglongxing2020/ML_code | 1 | 0\n",

Here, we present ClusterFoldSimilarity (CFS), a novel statistical method design to quantify the similarity between cell groups acroos any number of independent datasets, without the need for data correction or integration. By bypassing these processes, CFS avoids the introduction of artifacts and loss of information, offering a simple, efficient, and scalable solution. This method match groups of cells that exhibit conserved phenotypes across datasets, including different tissues and species, and in a multimodal scenario, including single-cell RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, single-cell proteomics, or, more broadly, data exhibiting differential abundance effects among groups of cells. Additionally, CFS performs feature selection, obtaining cross-dataset markers of the similar phenotypes observed, providing an inherent interpretability of relationships between cell populations. To showcase the effectiveness of our methodology we generated single-nuclei RNA-Seq data from the motor cortex and spinal cord of adult mice. By using CFS, we identified three distinct sub-populations of astrocytes conserved on both tissues. CFS includes various visualization methods for the interpretation of the similarity scores and similar cell populations. | https://github.com/OscarGVelasco/ClusterFoldSimilarity | 1 | 0\n",

Through conjugation, plasmid-encoded AMR genes are spread among neighbouring bacteria, irrespective of their strain or even their species. This process is very concerning from a public health perspective, as plasmid-borne AMR gene outbreaks are often not confined to single species or strains and are therefore more difficult to be fully uncovered. At the moment, the impact of plasmid conjugation on within-patient plasmid diversity is not well understood. In this work we will tackle the role of conjugation on within-patient plasmid diversity using a dataset of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPEs). The dataset of 256 sequences from 115 patients was sampled across England over 30 months. Each patient has more than one sequence, with at least one sequence carrying an OXA-48 gene, a well-known plasmid-borne carbapenemase-encoding gene. If more than one sequence carries the OXA-48 gene, they are carried on different bacterial hosts. Using a hybrid de novo-on-reference assembly pipeline, we were able to reconstruct the full OXA-48 plasmid from short read sequencing data for 232 of the 256 sequences. Of the 115 patients, 83 (72%) of patients had an identical OXA-48 plasmid in two or more sequences. Only 2 patients carried very different (>200 SNPs) alleles of the OXA-48 plasmid, probably from separate acquisitions. Our study shows that when more than one bacterial host carrying an OXA-48 plasmid is found in a patient, it is most likely that the same plasmid has been shared via conjugation. The event of separate acquisition of different plasmids in different bacterial hosts is highly unlikely in our dataset. | https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/within-patient-pOXA48-conjugation | 1 | 0\n",

In this study we aimed to use in silico simulations to identify a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug that can bind to the Cav3.1 T-type calcium channel. We used the automated docking suite GOLD v5.5 with the genetic algorithm to simulate molecular docking and predict the protein-ligand binding modes, and the ChemPLP empirical scoring function to estimate the binding affinities of 2,115 FDA-approved drugs to the human Cav3.1 channel. Drugs with high binding affinity and appropriate pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties were selected for molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MMPBSA) and molecular mechanics generalised Born surface area (MMGBSA) binding free energy calculations, GROMACS molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Monte Carlo Cell (MCell) simulations. The docking results indicated that the FDA-approved drug montelukast has a high binding affinity to Cav3.1, and data from the literature suggested that montelukast has the appropriate drug-like properties to cross the human blood-brain barrier and reach synapses in the central nervous system. MMPBSA, MMGBSA and MD simulations showed the high stability of the montelukast-Cav3.1 complex.

Utilizing contrastive language-structure pre training (CLSP) and structural contrastive learning, EmbedSimScore captures comprehensive features across different scales of protein structure.

Today, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with nearly 90,000 fatalities each year. By analyzing single-cell data from tumor-bearing colorectal cancer model mice with Lphn1 knockout and wild-type Lphn1, we identified five key target genes for anticancer therapy: Ulbp1, Klrk1, Ccl6, Tlr4, Cd48, Prdm5, Vstm2a, Ret, Oas2, Hdac11 and Ptchd4, along with their corresponding cell types. Additionally, we discovered tumor-inhibiting cell subpopulations, including Cd244a_T_cells_subcluster_1, Cd48_Cd244a_NK_cells_subcluster_2, and C3_Macrophages_subcluster_1, which are potential candidates for therapeutic intervention. We propose that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) serve as the primary antigen presenters for MHC class I, providing antigens to macrophages, NK cells, and T cells to combat colorectal cancer. From a cellular perspective, the knockout of Lphn1 activates the anti-colorectal cancer functions of subpopulations of macrophages, NK cells, and T cells. Macrophages enhance antitumor immune activity by engaging the Ulbp1-Klrk1 receptor pair to activate NK cells. Additionally, macrophages activate downstream functions of T cells against colorectal cancer through CD48 signaling. After the knockout of Lphn1, macrophages are recruited by autocrine Ccl6 and Ccl6 secReted by CAFs. They exhibit high expression of Tlr4 and have the potential to transition into M1-type macrophages due to changes in their cellular state. After the knockout of Lphn1, the CAFs were reduced by half. CAFs, which are part of the cell network communication associated with tumor cells, typically play an immunosuppressive role. A reduction by half indicates that the immunosuppression in the Lphn1 knockout group has significantly decreased. This suggests that the efficacy of various cancer immunotherapy drugs can be significantly enhanced. In specific cell types, the four colorectal cancer-resistant transcription factors Irf7, Nr2f1 (with uncertain function), Bclaf1, and Irf2 co-localize with Tlr4, Cd48, Prdm5, and Oas2, respectively, and have been analyzed by pyscenic to interact and functionally contribute to the resistance against colorectal cancer. The four differential metabolic pathways between the Lphn1 group and the luc group are Arginine and proline metabolism, Histidine metabolism, Phenylalanine metabolism, and Riboflavin metabolism, with Arginine and proline metabolism being more active in the Lphn1 group and Histidine metabolism being more active in the luc group. These findings could open new avenues for the treatment of colorectal cancer and contribute to the development of personalized medicine. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Therefore, there is a pressing need for a method capable of accurately and comprehensively annotating resistance genes at a genome-wide scale. In this study, we propose Evolutionary Scale Modeling for LRR (ESM-LRR), a novel approach based on the deep protein language model to accurately identify LRR domains which are substantially variable structures in disease-resistance proteins. ESM-LRR achieved its highest F1 score of 0.80 on a test set using the 90% identity as the matching threshold. Building upon ESM-LRR, we developed the Plant Disease-Resistance Gene Predictor (R-Predictor), a framework designed to simultaneously annotate 15 diverse domain topologies, extensively covering recently characterised resistance genes across the entire genome. R-Predictor integrates four modules, each employing superior methods that outperform existing methods (F1 score of 0.89 for RLKs and 0.88 for NLRs), demonstrating its high accuracy and practicality in annotating disease-resistance genes (R genes). R-Predictor were also applied to identify R genes in rice, tomato, and grapevine.  Furthermore, AlphaFold3 was employed to screen interactions between 1,116 protein pairs involving three NLRs identified exclusively by R-Predictor and 372 literature-reported plant-pathogen effectors, resulting in the identification of 15 putative NLR-effector complexes.

Reverting from corrupted to artifact-free images is a complex task. Deep Learning (DL) models have been employed to preserve data characteristics and to identify and correct those artifacts. We propose MOANA, a novel DL-based solution to correct artifacts in multi-contrast brain MRI scans. MOANA offers two models: the simulation and the correction models. The simulation model introduces perturbations similar to those occurring in an exam while preserving the original image as ground truth; this is required as publicly available datasets rarely have motion-corrupted images. It allows the addition of three types of artifacts with different degrees of severity. The DL-based correction model adds a fourth contrast to state-of-the-art solutions while improving the overall performance of the models. MOANA achieved the highest results in the FLAIR contrast, with a Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.9803 and a Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) of 0.8030.

GSEA and ssGSEA were developed for bulk samples rather than individual cell technologies such as microarrays and bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. The growing use of single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) raises the possibility of using ssGSEA to quantify pathway and process activation in individual cells. However, scRNA-seq data is much sparser than RNA-seq data. Here we show that ssGSEA as designed for bulk data is subject to some amount of score uncertainty and other technical issues when applied to individual cells from scRNA-seq data. We also show that a ssGSEA can be applied robustly to pseudobulk aggregate groups of a few hundred to a few thousand cells provided appropriate normalization is used. Finally, in comparing this approach to other ranked list enrichment methods, we find that the UCell method is most robust to sparsity.

However, existing computational methods do not properly distinguish cellular intrinsic variability and intercellular interactions, thus failing to capture spatial regulations for further biological discoveries. Here, we present Spatial Interaction Modeling using Variational Inference (SIMVI), an annotation-free framework that disentangles cell intrinsic and spatial-induced latent variables for modeling gene expression in spatial omics data. We establish rigorous theoretical support for SIMVI in disentangling intrinsic and spatial-induced variations. By this disentanglement, SIMVI enables estimation of spatial effects (SE) at a single-cell resolution, and opens up various opportunities for downstream analyses. To demonstrate the power of SIMVI, we applied SIMVI to spatial omics data from diverse platforms and tissues (MERFISH human cortex, Slide-seqv2 mouse hippocampus, Slide-tags human tonsil, spatial multiome human melanoma, cohort-level CosMx melanoma). In all tested datasets, SIMVI reveal refined disentangled variations and accurate spatial effects compared with various alternative methods. Moreover, our applications of SIMVI in these datasets uncovered complex spatial regulations and dynamics of biological significance. In the human tonsil data, SIMVI characterizes the cyclical spatial dynamics of germinal center B cells during maturation. In the multiome melanoma data, SIMVI incorporates ATAC-seq measurements to discover potential tumor epigenetic reprogramming states.

Our method (1) lets users select many biologically-relevant loss metrics (i.e. false discovery rate) and assigns reliable functional probabilities for annotating genes of unknown function; (2) achieves state-of-the-art performance in enzyme classification without training new models; and (3) robustly and rapidly pre-filters proteins for computationally intensive structural alignment algorithms.

This paper introduces an updated version of MetaLab, a software solution that streamlines metaproteomic analysis by supporting both DDA and DIA modes across various mass spectrometry (MS) platforms, including Orbitrap and timsTOF. MetaLab9s key feature is its ability to perform DIA analysis without DDA results, allowing more experimental flexibility. It incorporates a deep learning strategy to train a neural network model, enhancing the accuracy and coverage of DIA results. Evaluations using diverse datasets demonstrate MetaLab9s robust performance in accuracy and sensitivity. Benchmarks from large-scale human gut microbiome studies show that MetaLab increases peptide identification by 2.7 times compared to conventional methods.

Traditionally, these models are used solely for sampling docked poses, with a separate confidence model for ranking. We introduce DFMDock (Denoising Force Matching Dock), a diffusion model that unifies sampling and ranking within a single framework. DFMDock features two output heads: one for predicting forces and the other for predicting energies. The forces are trained using a denoising force matching objective, while the energy gradients are trained to align with the forces. This design enables our model to sample using the predicted forces and rank poses using the predicted energies, thereby eliminating the need for an additional confidence model. Our approach outperforms the previous diffusion model for protein docking, DiffDock-PP, with a sampling success rate of 44% compared to its 8%, and a Top-1 ranking success rate of 16% compared to 0% on the Docking Benchmark 5.5 test set.

We propose ConoDL, a framework for the generation and prediction of conotoxins, comprising the end-to-end conotoxin generation model (ConoGen) and the conotoxin prediction model (ConoPred). ConoGen employs transfer learning and a large language model (LLM) to tackle the challenges in conotoxin generation. Meanwhile, ConoPred filters artificial conotoxins generated by ConoGen, narrowing down the scope for subsequent research. A comprehensive evaluation of the peptide properties at both sequence and structure levels indicates that the artificial conotoxins generated by ConoDL exhibit a certain degree of similarity to natural conotoxins. Furthermore, ConoDL has generated artificial conotoxins with novel cysteine scaffolds. Therefore, ConoDL may uncover new cysteine scaffolds and conotoxin molecules, facilitating further exploration of the molecular space of conotoxins and the discovery of pharmacologically active variants.

Methylations and modifications occur at nucleotides such as adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and theanine (T) or uracil (U). Among all these provided datasets, some have the most common m6A methylation and others have m5C etc. using various real organism reference sequences such as human, mouse and artificial reference sequences which are prepared in the laboratory such as curlcake and IVT. These datasets are required to be organized by the methylation types to research ONT datasets. Here we provide a summary of the read qualities, base mapping success rates etc. for these methylation types and reference genomes. We have used minimap2 base mapping and longreadsum results. We find that methylated data have lower success rates than non-methylated data and mapping quality is lower for the real reference genomes such as human and mice. This could be because they contain more than 100,000 transcriptomes whereas artificial reference sequences contain only a few transcriptomes. Datasets which contain artificially created reference sequences have a higher quality than the others, thus they are recommended to be used for methylation or modification classification tasks in the future. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Furthermore, the gene-level information currently provided by these multispecies fish genomics databases is incomplete, and there is a lack of a comprehensive portal that can offer multidimensional genetic information. To address these challenges, we collected extensive multi-omics information on 35 fishes and established the primary comprehensive multi-omics data information platform for fish, FishCODE (http://bioinfo.ihb.ac.cn/fishcode). We have collected experimental background of dataset which pertaining to the target fishes, selected a range of datasets that encompass a broad spectrum of research areas, and downloaded the corresponding raw omics data from public repositories such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Through a unified pipeline analysis, FishCODE contains 11,216 samples from 540 sets of genomic, transcriptomic, and methylomic datasets. These data encompass transcript structure and expression, gene methylation levels, protein domains, protein subcellular localization, protein interactions, best matched protein (Swiss-Prot), associated SNP site information (47,111,018), orthologous genes, phylogenetic tree and GO/KEGG annotations. To facilitate comparison, we annotated the experimental background data sets of the FishCODE, FishGET, PhyloFish, FishSED and FishSCT databases using the Fish Experimental Condition Ontology. Currently, the FishCODE database omics dataset includes 146 unique experimental condition words, 654 cumulative experimental condition words, and 13 species with rich experimental background (more than 20 unique FECO words). These data are 3.5 times (42), 8.3 times (74), and 6.5 times (2) those of the second-ranked databases respectively.

SCFAs produced by gut microbiotas (GMs) are absorbed by host, reach bloodstream, and are distributed to different organs, thus influencing host physiology. However, due to the limited budget or the poor sensitivity of instruments, most studies on GMs have incomplete blood SCFA data, limiting our understanding of the metabolic processes within the host. To address this gap, we developed an innovative multi-task multi-view integrative approach (M2AE, Multi-task Multi-View Attentive Encoders), to impute blood SCFA levels using gut metagenomic sequencing (MGS) data, while taking into account the intricate interplay among the gut microbiome, dietary features, and host characteristics, as well as the nuanced nature of SCFA dynamics within the body. Here, each view represents a distinct type of data input (i.e., gut microbiome compositions, dietary features, or host characteristics). Our method jointly explores both view-specific representations and cross-view correlations for effective predictions of SCFAs. We applied M2AE to two in-house datasets, which both include MGS and blood SCFAs profiles, host characteristics, and dietary features from 964 subjects and 171 subjects, respectively. Results from both of two datasets demonstrated that M2AE outperforms traditional regression-based and neural-network based approaches in imputing blood SCFAs. Furthermore, a series of gut bacterial species (e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Clostridium asparagiforme), host characteristics (e.g., race, gender), as well as dietary features (e.g., intake of fruits, pickles) were shown to contribute greatly to imputation of blood SCFAs. These findings demonstrated that GMs, dietary features and host characteristics might contribute to the complex biological processes involved in blood SCFA productions. These might pave the way for a deeper and more nuanced comprehension of how these factors impact human health. | https://github.com/Wonderangela123/M2AE | 1 | 0\n",

From the onset, Unipept9s capabilities focused on tryptic peptides, utilizing the predictability and consistency of trypsin digestion to efficiently construct a protein reference database. However, the evolving landscape of proteomics and emerging fields like immunopeptidomics necessitate a more versatile approach that extends beyond the analysis of tryptic peptides. In this article, we present Unipept 6.0, featuring a novel protein reference database, powered by a Sparse Suffix Array index. This advancement enables the analysis of semi-tryptic peptides, peptides with missed cleavages, and non-tryptic peptides such as those from immunopeptidomics (e.g. MHC- and HLA-peptides).

The latter foster an increasing amount of genomic sequences that can be explored with reverse ecology approaches to raise hypotheses on the corresponding populations. Building upon genome scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) obtained from genome annotations, metabolic models predict contextualised phenotypes using nutrient information. We developed the tool Seed2LP, addressing the inverse problem of predicting source nutrients, or seeds, from a GSMN and a metabolic objective. The originality of Seed2LP is its hybrid model, combining a scalable and discrete Boolean approximation of metabolic activity, with the numerically accurate flux balance analysis (FBA). Seed inference is highly customisable, with multiple search and solving modes, exploring the search space of external and internal metabolites combinations. Application to a benchmark of 107 curated GSMNs highlights the usefulness of a logic modelling method over a graph-based approach to predict seeds, and the relevance of hybrid solving to satisfy FBA constraints. Focusing on the dependency between metabolism and environment, Seed2LP is a computational support contributing to address the multifactorial challenge of culturing possibly uncultured microorganisms.

In particular, we introduce a tool that extracts a skeleton distribution of the posterior tree distribution that contains the core relationships by removing a minimal subset of rogues.

These issues are magnified by the increased noise, significant sparsity and multi-modal distributions characteristic of single cell data. One promising approach for addressing these challenges is gene set testing, or pathway analysis. Unfortunately, statistical and biological differences between single cell and bulk transcriptomic data make it challenging to use existing gene set collections, which were developed for bulk tissue analysis, on scRNA-seq data. In this paper, we describe a procedure for customizing gene set collections originally created for bulk tissue analysis to reflect the structure of gene activity within specific cell types. Our approach leverages information about mean gene expression in the 81 human cell types profiled via scRNA-seq by the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) Single Cell Type Atlas. This HPA information is used to compute cell type-specific gene and gene set weights that can be used to filter or weight gene set collections. As demonstrated through the analysis of immune cell scRNA-seq data using gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB), accounting for cell type-specificity can significantly improve gene set testing power and interpretability.

However, the complexity of AIRR calls for advanced, specialized methods to extract meaningful biological insights. These sophisticated approaches often present challenges for researchers with limited bioinformatics expertise, hindering access to comprehensive immune system analysis. To address this challenge, we developed AnalyzAIRR, an AIRR-compliant R package enabling advanced bulk AIRR sequencing data. The tool integrates state-of-the-art statistical and visualization methods applicable at various levels of granularity. It offers a platform for general data exploration, filtering and manipulation, and in-depth cross-comparisons of AIRR datasets, aimed at answering specific biological questions.

In this study, we use data from ribo-seq experiments to model ribosome densities, and in turn, predict the speed of translation. The proposed method, RiboGL, combines graph and recurrent neural networks to account for both graph and sequence-based features. The model takes a graph representing the secondary structure of the mRNA sequence as input, which incorporates both sequence and structural codon neighbors. In our experiments, RiboGL greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art RiboMIMO model for ribosome density prediction. We also conduct ablation studies to justify the design choices made in building the pipeline. Additionally, we use gradient-based interpretability to understand how the codon context and the structural neighbors affect the ribosome density at the A-site. By individually analyzing the genes in the dataset, we elucidate how structural neighbors could also potentially play a role in defining the ribosome density. Importantly, since these neighbors can be far away in the sequence, a recurrent model alone could not easily extract this information. This study lays the foundation for understanding how the mRNA secondary structure can be exploited for ribosome density prediction, and how in the future other graph modalities such as features from the nascent polypeptide can be used to further our understanding of translation in general. | https://github.com/cgob/codonDT_snakemake, https://github.com/vam-sin/ribogl/ | 1 | 0\n",

Early diagnosis and interventions enable the implementation of measures to reduce or slow further regression of the disease, preventing individuals from severe brain function decline. The current framework of AD diagnosis depends on A/T/(N) biomarkers detection from cerebrospinal fluid or brain imaging data, which is invasive and expensive during the data acquisition process. Moreover, the pathophysiological changes of AD accumulate in amino acids, metabolism, neuroinflammation, etc., resulting in heterogeneity in newly registered patients. Recently, next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have found to be a non-invasive, efficient and less-costly alternative on AD screening. However, most of existing studies rely on single omics only. To address these concerns, we introduce WIMOAD, a weighted integration of multi-omics data for AD diagnosis. WIMOAD synergistically leverages specialized classifiers for patients9 paired gene expression and methylation data for multi-stage classification. The resulting scores were then stacked with MLP-based meta-models for performance improvement. The prediction results of two distinct meta-models were integrated with optimized weights for the final decision-making of the model, providing higher performance than using single omics only. Remarkably, WIMOAD achieves significantly higher performance than using single omics alone in the classification tasks. The model9s overall performance also outperformed most existing approaches, highlighting its ability to effectively discern intricate patterns in multi-omics data and their correlations with clinical diagnosis results. In addition, WIMOAD also stands out as a biologically interpretable model by leveraging the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to elucidate the contributions of each gene from each omics to the model output. We believe WIMOAD is a very promising tool for accurate AD diagnosis and effective biomarker discovery across different progression stages, which eventually will have consequential impacts on early treatment intervention and personalized therapy design on AD. | https://github.com/wan-mlab/WIMOAD | 1 | 0\n",

This is in part because no named entity recognition (NER) system exists, which can comprehensively detect all types of LSFs in text. The task is challenging due to their inherent diversity, lack of a comprehensive LSF classification for dictionary-based NER, and lack of a cor-pus for deep learning-based NER. Results: We present a novel Lifestyle Factor Ontology (LSFO), which we used to develop a dic-tionary-based system for recognition and normalization of LSFs. Additionally, we introduce a manu-ally annotated corpus for LSFs (LSF200) suitable for training and evaluation of NER systems, and use it to train a transformer-based system. Evaluating the performance of both NER systems on the corpus revealed an F-score of 64% for the dictionary-based system and 76% for the transformer-based system.

However, most existing analyses rely on bulk data or cultured cell lines, which may fail to identify cell-type-specific enhancers and target genes. Recently, single-cell multimodal data measuring both gene expression and chromatin accessibility within the same cells have enabled the inference of enhancer-gene pairs in a cell-type-specific and context-specific manner. However, this task is challenged by the data9s high sparsity, sequencing depth variation, and the computational burden of analyzing a large number of enhancer-gene pairs. To address these challenges, we propose scMultiMap, a statistical method that infers enhancer-gene association from sparse multimodal counts using a joint latent-variable model. It adjusts for technical confounding, permits fast moment-based estimation and provides analytically derived p-values. In systematic analyses of blood and brain data, scMultiMap shows appropriate type I error control, high statistical power with greater reproducibility across independent datasets and stronger consistency with orthogonal data modalities. Meanwhile, its computational cost is less than 1% of existing methods. When applied to single-cell multimodal data from postmortem brain samples from Alzheimer9s disease (AD) patients and controls, scMultiMap gave the highest heritability enrichment in microglia and revealed new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of AD GWAS variants in microglia. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Despite the critical role of human G protein-coupled receptors (hGPCRs) in FDA approved drugs, exhaustive in-distribution drug-target interaction (DTI) testing across all pairs of hGPCRs and known drugs is rare due to significant economic and technical challenges. This often leaves off-target effects unexplored, which poses a considerable risk to drug safety. In contrast to the traditional focus on out-of-distribution (OOD) exploration (drug discovery), we introduce a neighbourhood-to-prediction model termed Chemical Space Neural Networks (CSNN) that leverages network homophily and training-free graph neural networks (GNNs) with Labels as Features (LaF). We show that CSNN′s ability to make accurate predictions strongly correlates with network homophily.

This study presents an innovative approach to drug development by integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to identify the potential BACE1 inhibitors. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of protein-ligand interactions, the current study employed a machine learning model to generate novel ligands with high binding affinity and specificity for the BACE1 active site. The model9s efficacy was validated through molecular docking studies, which demonstrated superior binding affinities compared to existing FDA-approved inhibitors such as Atabecestat and Lanabecestat. The findings reveal that the top candidate, MLC10, exhibits a unique mechanism of action by promoting controlled flexibility in BACE1, contrasting with the rigid conformations induced by traditional inhibitors. This dynamic modulation enhances the enzyme9s inhibition, suggesting a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, solvent-accessible surface area analyses indicate that MLC10 facilitates a more favourable protein conformation, potentially altering catalytic behaviour through increased solvent interactions. This work underscores the transformative potential of machine learning in drug discovery, paving the way for the development of next-generation BACE1 inhibitors.

We introduce MorphoGenie, an unsupervised deeplearning framework designed to address these challenges in singlecell morphological profiling. Enabling disentangled representation learning integrated with high-fidelity image reconstructions, MorphoGenie possesses a critical attribute to learn a compact, generalizable and interpretable latent space. This facilitates the extraction of biologically meaningful features without human annotation, additionally overcoming the \"curse of dimensionality\" inherent in manual methods. Unlike prior models, MorphoGenie introduces a systematic approach to mapping disentangled latent representations to fundamental hierarchical morphological attributes, ensuring both semantic and biological interpretability. Moreover, it adheres to the concept of combinatorial generalization, a core principle of human intelligence, which greatly enhances the model9s capacity to generalize across a broad spectrum of imaging modalities (e.g., quantitative phase imaging and fluorescence imaging) and experimental conditions (ranging from discrete cell type/state classification to continuous trajectory inference). The framework offers a new, generalized strategy for unbiased and comprehensive morphological profiling, potentially revealing insights into cellular behavior in health and disease that might be overlooked by expert visual examination. | https://github.com/rashmisrm/MorphoGenie | 1 | 0\n",

The pixel-wise filtering is based on comparison of the pixel intensity with the mean intensity of pixels in its local neighborhood. The pixel is given a background or foreground label depending on whether its intensity is less than or greater than the mean respectively. Multiple labels are generated for the same pixel by computing mean expression values by varying neighborhood size. These labels are accumulated to decide the final pixel label. We demonstrate that the performance of our filter favorably compares with state-of-the-art image processing, machine learning, and deep learning methods. We present three use cases that demonstrate its effectiveness, and also show how it can be used in multiplexed fluorescence imaging contexts and as a denoising step in image segmentation.

We propose DeepAutoCoV, an unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection system to predict future dominant lineages (FDLs).

DeepAutoCoV is trained and validated by assembling global and country-specific data sets from over 16 million Spike protein sequences sampled over a period of about 4 years. DeepAutoCoV successfully flags FDLs at very low frequencies (0.01%,3%), with median lead times of 4-17 weeks, and predicts FDLs ~5 and ~25 times better than a baseline approach For example, the B.1.617.2 vaccine reference strain was flagged as FDL when its frequency was only 0.01%, more than a year before it was considered for an updated COVID-19 vaccine.

Further, we fine-tune ProtBFN on heavy chains from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) to obtain an antibody-specific model, AbBFN, which we use to evaluate zero-shot conditional generation capabilities.

Identification of B-ALL subtypes can facilitate risk stratification and enable tailored therapeutic approaches. Existing methods for B-ALL subtyping primarily depend on immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and genomic analyses, which would be costly, complicated, and laborious in clinical practice applications. To overcome these challenges, we present RanBALL (an Ensemble Random Projection-Based Model for Identifying B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Subtypes), an accurate and cost-effective model for B-ALL subtype identification based on transcriptomic profiling only. RanBALL leverages random projection (RP) to construct an ensemble of dimension-reduced multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classifiers for B-ALL subtyping. Results based on 10 times 5-fold cross validation tests for &gt;1700 B-ALL patients demonstrated that the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 93.35%, indicating promising prediction capabilities of RanBALL for B-ALL subtyping. The high accuracies of RanBALL suggested that our model could effectively capture underlying patterns of transcriptomic profiling for accurate B-ALL subtype identification.

Sequencing and taxonomic classification were used to generate signals for each sample and taxa of interest, and to estimate the limit of detection (LOD), the response function, and linear dynamic range. We found that the LODs for taxa spiked into CSF ranged from approximately (0.1 to 0.3) copy/μL, with a linearity of 0.96 to 0.99. For stool, the LODs ranged from (10 to 221) copy/μL, with a linearity of 0.99 to 1.01. Further, discriminating different E. coli strains proved to be workflow-dependent, as only one classifier:database combination of the three tested showed the ability to differentiate the two pathogenic and  commensal strains. Surprisingly, when we compared the response functions of the same taxa in the two different sample types, we found those functions to be the same, despite large differences in LODs. This suggests that the agnostic-diagnostic theory for metagenomics may apply to different target organisms and different sample types. Using RMs, we were able to generate quantitative analytical performance metrics for each workflow and sample set, enabling relatively rapid workflow screening before employing clinical samples.

Previous evaluations have shown that pre-trained gLMs can be leveraged to improve predictive performance across a broad range of regulatory genomics tasks, albeit using relatively simple benchmark datasets and baseline models. Since the gLMs in these studies were tested upon fine-tuning their weights for each downstream task, determining whether gLM representations embody a foundational understanding of cis-regulatory biology remains an open question. Here we evaluate the representational power of pre-trained gLMs to predict and interpret cell-type-specific functional genomics data that span DNA and RNA regulation. Our findings suggest that probing the representations of pre-trained gLMs do not offer substantial advantages over conventional machine learning approaches that use one-hot encoded sequences.

Analyzing scRNA-seq data relies on linear dimensionality reduction (DR) methods like principal component analysis (PCA). These methods decompose high-dimensional gene expression profiles into tractable factor representations and prototypical gene expression patterns (components), facilitating the study of cell type variation. However, integrating study covariates within linear DR frameworks remains a challenging task. We present scPCA, a flexible DR framework that jointly models cellular heterogeneity and conditioning variables, allowing it to recover an integrated factor representation and reveal transcriptional changes across conditions and components of the decomposition. We show that scPCA extracts an interpretable latent representation by analyzing unstimulated and IFN-beta-treated PBMCs, and showcase that the model may be employed to effectively address batch effects. We examine age-related changes in rodent lung cell populations, uncovering a previously unreported surge in Ccl5 expression in T cells. We illustrate how scPCA may be employed to identify coordinated transcriptional changes across multiple time-points in depolarized visual cortex neurons. Finally, we show that scPCA elucidates transcriptional shifts in CRISPR-Cas9 chordin knockout zebrafish fish single-cell data despite large difference cell abundance across conditions.

These data-driven methods require comprehensive training sets to deliver reliable results. However, large unbiased datasets for variant prioritization and effect predictions are rare as most of the available databases do not represent a broad ensemble of variant effects and are often biased towards coding genome, or even towards few well-studied genes. To overcome these issues, we propose several alternative training sets derived from subsets of human standing variation. Specifically, we use variants identified from whole-genome sequences of 71,156 individuals contained in gnomAD v3.0 and approximate the benign set with frequent and the deleterious set with rare standing variation. We apply the Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion framework (CADD) and train several alternative models using CADD v1.6. Using the NCBI ClinVar validation set, we demonstrate that the alternative models have state-of-the art accuracy, outperforming the widely used pathogenicity score CADD v1.6 in certain genomic regions. Being larger than conventional databases, including the evolutionary-derived training dataset of about 30 million variants in CADD, standing variation cover a broader range of genomic regions and rare instances of the applied annotations. For example, they cover more recent evolutionary changes common in gene regulatory regions, which are more challenging to assess with conventional tools. Finally, datasets derived from standing variation better represent allelic changes in the human genome and do not require extensive simulations and adaptations to annotations of the evolutionary-derived sequence alterations used for CADD training.

Downstream effectors activated by cOAs are typically non-specific proteins that induce damage to essential cellular components, thereby preventing phage epidemics. Due to these toxic effects, it is crucial that the production and concentration of cOAs remain under tight regulatory control during infection-free periods or when deactivating the immune response after clearing an infection. Type III CRISPR loci often encode enzymes known as ring nucleases (RNs) that bind and degrade specific cOAs, while some effectors are auto-deactivating. Despite the discovery of several classes of RNs, a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis of type III CRISPR-Cas loci in this context is lacking. Here, we examined 38,742 prokaryotic genomes to provide a global overview of type III CRISPR loci, focussing on the known and predicted RNs. The candidate RNs Csx16 and Csx20 are confirmed as active enzymes, joining Crn1-3. Distributions and patterns of co-occurrence of RNs and associated effectors are explored, allowing the conclusion that a sizeable majority of type III CRISPR systems regulate cOA levels by degrading the signalling molecules, which has implications for cell fate following viral infection. | https://github.com/vihoikka/ring_nucleases | 1 | 0\n",

To address these challenges, we introduce RNA-DCGen, a generalized framework for RNA sequence generation that is adaptable to any structural or functional properties through straightforward finetuning with an RNA language model (RNA-LM). Additionally, RNA-DCGen can enforce conditions on the generated sequences by fixing specific conserved regions.

Following the revolution in single protein 3D structure prediction, researchers have focused on repurposing or developing deep learning models for sampling alternative protein conformations. In this work, we explored whether continuous compact representations of protein motions could be predicted directly from protein sequences, without exploiting nor sampling protein structures. Our approach, called SeaMoon, leverages protein Language Model (pLM) embeddings as input to a lightweight (≈1M trainable parameters) convolutional neural network. SeaMoon achieves a success rate of up to 40% when assessed against ≈1~000 collections of experimental conformations exhibiting a wide range of motions. SeaMoon capture motions not accessible to the normal mode analysis, an unsupervised physics-based method relying solely on a protein structure9s 3D geometry, and generalises to proteins that do not have any detectable sequence similarity to the training set. SeaMoon is easily retrainable with novel or updated pLMs. | None | 2 | 0\n",

However, it remains a significant challenge to effectively integrate and interpret these data, often originating from different samples, technologies, and developmental stages. In this paper, we present INSPIRE, a deep learning method for integrative analyses of multiple spatial transcriptomics datasets to address this challenge. With designs of graph neural networks and an adversarial learning mechanism, INSPIRE enables spatially informed and adaptable integration of data from varying sources. By incorporating non-negative matrix factorization, INSPIRE uncovers interpretable spatial factors with corresponding gene programs, revealing tissue architectures, cell type distributions and biological processes. We demonstrate the capabilities of INSPIRE by applying it to human cortex slices from different samples, mouse brain slices with complementary views, mouse hippocampus and embryo slices generated through different technologies, and spatiotemporal organogenesis atlases containing half a million spatial spots. INSPIRE shows superior performance in identifying detailed biological signals, effectively borrowing information across distinct profiling technologies, and elucidating dynamical changes during embryonic development.

Among the various approaches for multi-view clustering, nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (NMTF) and nonnegative Tucker decomposition (NTD) are advantageous in learning low-rank embeddings with promising interpretability. Besides, there is a need to handle unwanted drivers of clusterings (i.e. confounders). Results: In this work, we introduce a novel multi-view clustering method based on NMTF and NTD, named INMTD, that integrates omics and 3D imaging data to derive unconfounded subgroups of individuals. In the application to real-life facial-genomic data, INMTD generated biologically relevant embeddings for individuals, genetics and facial morphology. By removing confounded embedding vectors, we derived an unconfounded clustering with better internal and external quality; the genetic and facial annotations of each derived subgroup highlighted distinctive characteristics. In conclusion, INMTD can effectively integrate omics data and 3D images for unconfounded clustering with biologically meaningful interpretation.

Current methods often fail to integrate diverse multi-relational biological data meaningfully, limiting the discovery of novel risk genes and drugs. To address this, we present MedGraphNet, a multi-relational Graph Neural Network (GNN) model designed to infer relationships among drugs, genes, diseases, and phenotypes. MedGraphNet initializes nodes using informative embeddings from existing text knowledge, allowing for robust integration of various data types and improved generalizability. Our results demonstrate that MedGraphNet matches and often outperforms traditional single-relation approaches, particularly in scenarios with isolated or sparsely connected nodes. The model shows generalizability to external datasets, achieving high accuracy in identifying disease-gene associations and drug-phenotype relationships. Notably, MedGraphNet accurately inferred drug side effects without direct training on such data. Using Alzheimer9s disease as a case study, MedGraphNet successfully identified relevant phenotypes, genes, and drugs, corroborated by existing literature.

Though current methods achieve high accuracy in standard cases, LAI is still challenging when reference populations are more similar (e.g., intra-continental), when the number of reference populations is too numerous, or when the admixture events are deep in time, all of which are increasingly unavoidable in large biobanks. Here, we present a new LAI method, Recomb-Mix. Recomb-Mix integrates the elements of existing methods of the site-based Li and Stephens model and introduces a new graph collapsing trick to simplify counting paths with the same ancestry label readout. Through comprehensive benchmarking on various simulated datasets, we show that Recomb-Mix is more accurate than existing methods in diverse sets of scenarios while being competitive in terms of resource efficiency.

However, the underlying mechanisms of the sex-dimorphic aging remain foggy, with limited studies across multiple tissues. We systematically analyzed ~17,000 transcriptomes from 35 human tissues to quantitatively evaluate the individual and combined contributions of sex and age to transcriptomic variations. We discovered extensive sex-dimorphisms during aging with distinct patterns of change in gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). Intriguingly, the male-biased age-associated AS events have a stronger association with Alzheimer9s disease, and the females-biased events are often regulated by several sex-biased splicing factors that may be controlled by estrogen receptors.  Breakpoint analysis showed sex-dimorphic aging rates that are significantly associated with decline of sex hormones, with males having a larger and earlier transcriptome change.

Breakthroughs in improving scalability have led to the creation of organism-wide transcriptomic datasets, aiming to comprehensively profile the cell types and states within an organism throughout its lifecycle.

Considering how the skeleton not only serves as the central framework of the vertebrate body but is also the home of the hematopoietic niche and a central player in major metabolic and homeostatic processes, this presents a major deficit in current reference atlas projects. To address this issue, we integrated ten separate scRNA-seq datasets containing limb skeletal cells and their developmental precursors, generating an atlas of 133 332 cells. This limb skeletal cell atlas describes cells across the mesenchymal lineage from the induction of the limb to the adult bone and encompasses 39 different cell states.

      "Viruses are integral to every biome on Earth, yet we still need a more comprehensive picture of their identity and global distribution. Global metagenomics sequencing efforts revealed the genomic content of tens of thousands of environmental samples, however identifying the viral sequences in these datasets remains challenging due to their vast genomic diversity. Here, we address identifying bacteriophage sequences in sequencing data. In a recent benchmarking paper, we observed that existing deep-learning tools show a high true positive rate, but often produce many false positives when confronted with divergent sequences. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Jaeger, a novel deep-learning method designed specifically for identifying bacteriophage genome fragments. Extensive benchmarking on the IMG/VR database and real-world metagenomes reveals Jaeger9s consistent performance across various scenarios. Applying Jaeger to over 16,000 metagenomic assemblies from the MGnify database yielded over five million putative phage contigs at an estimated 2-27% false discovery rate.

Many SVGs show spatial variation in expression that is highly correlated with cell type categories or compositions, leading to the concept of cell type-specific spatially variable genes (ctSVGs). Existing statistical methods for detecting ctSVGs treat cell type-specific spatial effects as fixed effects when modeling, resulting in a critical issue: the testing results are not invariant to the rotation of spatial coordinates. Additionally, an SVG may display random spatial patterns within a cell type, and a ctSVG may exhibit random spatial patterns from a general perspective, indicating that an SVG does not necessarily have to be a ctSVG, and vice versa. This poses challenges in real analysis when detecting SVGs or ctSVGs. To address these problems, we propose STANCE, a unified statistical model developed to detect both SVG and ctSVGs in spatial transcriptomics. By integrating gene expression, spatial location, and cell type composition through a linear mixed-effect model, STANCE enables the identification of both SVGs and ctSVGs in an initial stage, followed by a second stage test dedicated to ctSVG detection. Its design ensures robustness in complex scenarios and the results are spatial rotation invariant. We demonstrated the performance of STANCE through comprehensive simulations and analyses of three public datasets. The downstream analyses based on ctSVGs detected by STANCE suggest promising future applications of the model in spatial transcriptomics and various areas of genome biology.

While amino acids (AA) such as alanine and leucine are known to promote helix formation, proline and glycine disfavor it. Helical structure formation, however, also depends on its environment, and hence, prior prediction of a mutational effect on a helical structure is difficult. Here, we employ a reinforcement learning algorithm to develop a predictive model for helix-disrupting mutations. We start with a toy model consisting of helices with only 30 AA and train different models. Our results show that only a few mutations lead to a drastic disruption of the target helix. We further extend our approach to helices in proteins and validate the results using rigorous free energy calculations. Our strategy identifies amino acids crucial for maintaining structural integrity and predicts key mutations that could alter protein function.

However, monitoring of astaxanthin content in cultures remains challenging and relies on invasive, time consuming and expensive approaches. In this study, we employed reflectance hyperspectral imaging (HSI) of H. pluvialis suspensions within the visible spectrum, combined with a 1-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the astaxanthin content (ug mg-1) as quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This approach had low average prediction error (5.9%) across a gradient of astaxanthin contents and was only unreliable at very low contents (&lt;0.6 micrograms mg-1). In addition, our machine learning model outperformed single or dual wavelength linear regression models even when the spectral data was obtained with a spectrophotometer coupled with an integrating sphere. Overall, this study proposes the use of HSI in combination with a CNN for precise non-invasive quantification of astaxanthin in cell suspensions. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Our objective was to demonstrate the significant impact of SRMs on the accuracy of pose prediction. To achieve this, we evaluated our method on high-quality protein-ligand complex structures, focusing on the presence and absence of SRMs during molecular docking studies. We have extracted the co-crystal ligands from the selected crystal structure and were redocked in presence and absence of SRM to assess their influence. Additionally, we calculated the free energy of the docked poses using the Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method, comparing the results in the presence and absence of SRMs. The findings revealed that redocking performed in the presence of SRMs significantly improved the prediction of biologically significant/crystallographically relevant poses.

Although infections in certain individuals have been linked to other species, Cryptosporidium parvum is the main cause of illnesses in humans. Lactate Dehydrogenase, Inosine 59-Monophosphate Dehydrogenase (IMPDH), and several other targets have been identified by the genome sequencing of C. parvum. Bioactive phytochemicals derived from nature have enormous potential as anti-cryptosporidiosis agents. The study aimed to identify new anti-cryptosporidial agents that work against the IMPDH of the parasite by using integrated in silico approaches. In this study, a total of 24 bioactive phytochemicals were screened virtually through molecular docking and ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity) analyses. Four lead compounds were identified, including Brevelin A (-8.9 kcal/mol), Vernodalin (-8.7 kcal/mol), Luteolin (-8.6 kcal/mol), and Pectolinarigenin (-8.1 kcal/mol), against the IMPDH protein (PDB ID: 4IXH) from the parasite. All the lead compounds were found to possess favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. The toxicity analysis showed satisfactory results with no major side effects. All of the selected compounds showed no violation of Lipinski9s rules of five, indicating the possibility of oral bioavailability as potential drug candidates. Target class prediction unveiled enzymes in most of the cases, and some experimental and investigational drugs were found to be structurally similar to the lead compounds.

The Tm is the temperature at which 50% of the protein loses its native structure and activity. Existing methods for predicting Tm have two major limitations: first, they are often trained on redundant proteins, and second, they do not allow users to design proteins with the desired Tm. To address these limitations, we developed a regression method for predicting the Tm value of proteins using 17,312 non-redundant proteins, where no two proteins are more than 40% similar. We used 80% of the data for training and testing; remaining 20% of the data for validation. Initially, we developed a machine learning model using standard features from protein sequences. Our best model, developed using Shannon entropy for all residues, achieved the highest Pearson correlation of 0.80 with an R2 of 0.63 between the predicted and actual Tm of proteins on the validation dataset. Next, we fine-tuned large language models (e.g., ProtBert, ProtGPT2, ProtT5) on our training dataset and generated embeddings. These embeddings have been used for developing machine learning models. Our best model, developed using ProtBert embeddings, achieved a maximum correlation of 0.89 with an R2 of 0.80 on the validation dataset. Finally, we developed an ensemble method that combines standard protein features and embeddings. One of the aims of the study is to assist the scientific community in the design of targeted melting temperatures.

One example is the SkSES method for GWAS on a cohort of case and control samples from multiple institutions, which identifies the most significant SNPs in a privacy-preserving manner without disclosing sensitive genotype information to other institutions or the cloud service provider. Here we show how to improve the performance of SkSES on large datasets by augmenting it with a learning-augmented approach. Specifically, we show how individual institutions can perform smaller scale GWAS on their own datasets and identify two sets of variants according to certain criteria, which are then used to guide the sketching process to more accurately identify significant variants over the collective dataset.

This often involves a statistical test to determine whether an observed correlation is stronger than expected under the null hypothesis of independence. Testing for dependence between nonstationary time series with only one experimental replicate is exceedingly challenging. However, with many replicates, a nonparametric trial-swapping permutation test can be employed, comparing within-replicate correlations to between-replicate correlations. Although largely assumption-free, this test is severely limited by the number of replicates because its minimum achievable p-value is 1/n! where n is the number of replicates. This curtails its applicability to many biomedical studies, where n is frequently as low as 3, which would render significance thresholds like 0.05 unattainable. To address this, we propose modified permutation tests that can report lower p-values of 2/n<sup>n</sup> or 1/n<sup>n</sup> when there is strong evidence of dependence. We prove that the tests guarantee a false positive rate at or below the significance level, as long as replicates come from independent and identical experiments. We demonstrate this approach by confirming the observation that groups of zebrafish swim faster when directionally aligned, using an existing dataset with 3 biological replicates. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Throughout these CAPRI rounds, we used a plethora of computational strategies to predict the structure of protein complexes. Of the 10 targets comprising 24 interfaces, we achieved acceptable or better models for 3 targets in the human category and 1 in the server category. Our performance in the scoring challenge was slightly better, with our simple scoring protocol being the only one capable of identifying an acceptable model for Target 234. This result highlights the robustness of the simple, fully physics-based HADDOCK scoring function, especially when applied to highly flexible antibody-antigen complexes. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning for structural biology and the dramatic improvement in our success rates after the public release of Alphafold2, we identify the integration of classical approaches like HADDOCK with AI-driven structure prediction methods as a key strategy for improving the accuracy of model generation and scoring. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) can be used to evaluate pharmacological agents targeting these factors and to identify drivers of disease and drug resistance. However, GRN methods that rely solely on gene expression often fail to account for post-transcriptional modulation of TF function. We present Epiregulon, a method that constructs GRNs from single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data for accurate prediction of TF activity. This is achieved by considering the co-occurrence of TF expression and chromatin accessibility at TF binding sites in each cell. We leverage ChIP-seq data to extend inference to transcriptional coregulators lacking defined motifs or TF harboring neomorphic mutations. Epiregulon accurately predicted the effects of AR inhibition across various drug modalities including an AR antagonist and an AR degrader, delineated the mechanisms of a SMARCA4 degrader by identifying context-dependent interaction partners and prioritized known and novel drivers of lineage reprogramming and tumorigenesis.

Current predictive models of 3D genome folding can effectively infer pairwise cis-chromatin interactions from the primary DNA sequence but generally ignore trans contacts. There is an unmet need for robust models of trans-genome organization that provide insights into their underlying principles and functional relevance. We present TwinC, an interpretable convolutional neural network model that reliably predicts trans contacts measurable through genome-wide chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C). TwinC uses a paired sequence design from replicate Hi-C experiments to learn single base pair relevance in trans interactions across two stretches of DNA. The method achieves high predictive accuracy (AUROC=0.80) on a cross-chromosomal test set from Hi-C experiments in heart tissue. Mechanistically, the neural network learns the importance of compartments, chromatin accessibility, clustered transcription factor binding and G-quadruplexes in forming trans contacts.

Traditional bioinformatics tools require substantial programming expertise, limiting accessibility for experimental researchers. Despite efforts to develop user-friendly platforms, the complexity of these tools continues to hinder efficient biological data analysis. In this paper, we introduce BioMANIA--an AI-driven, natural language-oriented bioinformatics pipeline that addresses these challenges by enabling the automatic and codeless execution of biological analyses. BioMANIA leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret user instructions and execute sophisticated bioinformatics workflows, integrating API knowledge from existing Python tools. By streamlining the analysis process, BioMANIA simplifies complex omics data exploration and accelerates bioinformatics research. Compared to relying on general-purpose LLMs to conduct analysis from scratch, BioMANIA, informed by domain-specific biological tools, helps mitigate hallucinations and significantly reduces the likelihood of confusion and errors.

On the functional dimension, metaproteomics data can be used to quantify beta-diversity to understand how microbial community functional profiles vary under different environmental conditions. Conventional approaches to metaproteomic functional beta diversity often treat protein functions as independent features, ignoring the evolutionary relationships among microbial taxa from which different proteins originate. A more informative functional distance metric that incorporates evolutionary relatedness is needed to better understand microbiome functional dissimilarities. Results: Here, we introduce PhyloFunc, a novel functional beta-diversity metric that incorporates microbiome phylogeny to inform on metaproteomic functional distance. Leveraging the phylogenetic framework of weighted UniFrac distance, PhyloFunc innovatively utilizes branch lengths to weigh between-sample functional distances for each taxon, rather than differences in taxonomic abundance as in weighted UniFrac. Proof-of-concept using a simulated toy dataset and a real dataset from mouse inoculated with a synthetic gut microbiome and fed different diets show that PhyloFunc successfully captured functional compensatory effects between phylogenetically related taxa. We further tested a third dataset of complex human gut microbiomes treated with five different drugs to compare PhyloFunc9s performance with other traditional distance methods. PCoA and machine learning-based classification algorithms revealed higher sensitivity of PhyloFunc in microbiome responses to paracetamol. We offer PhyloFunc as an open-source Python package (https://pydigger.com/pypi/PhyloFunc) that efficiently calculates functional beta-diversity distances between sample pairs and generates distance matrices for all samples. Conclusions: Unlike traditional approaches that consider metaproteomics features as independent and unrelated, PhyloFunc acknowledges the role of phylogenetic context in shaping the functional landscape in metaproteomes. In particular, we report that PhyloFunc accounts for the functional compensatory effect of taxonomically related species. It is effective, ecologically significant, and has better sensitivity, as evidenced by the particular applications we presented. | https://github.com/lumanottawa/PhyloFunc/tree/main/0_PhyloFunk_package_tutorial | 1 | 0\n",

Based on an analysis of publicly available data of women patients, this study found that the pathology of AD was suggested to be nonuniform; however, several different typical forms of cognitive deterioration were observed. First, cluster analysis was performed on individuals diagnosed with \"No Cognitive Impairment (NCI)\", \"Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)\", and \"Alzheimer9s Disease (AD)\" stages in clinical trials using gene expression and epigenome data. NCI was found to contain at least two substages, whereas MCI and AD were found to contain four and six substages, respectively. An inference of adjacency networks among substages, evaluated via partition-based graph abstraction using the gene expression profiles of individuals, suggested the possibilities of multiple typical disease progression pathways from NCI through different MCI substages and then to different AD substages.

Results: Microsatellites density landscapes of all 24 chromosomes were built here for the first complete reference sequence of human genome T2T-CHM13. These landscapes showed that short tandem repeats (STRs) are prone to aggregate characteristically to form a large number of STRs density peaks. We classified 8,823 High Microsatellites Density Peaks (HMDPs), 35,257 Middle Microsatellites Density Peaks (MMDPs) and 199, 649 Low Microsatellites Density Peaks (LMDPs) on the 24 chromosomes; and also classified the motif types of every microsatellites density peak. These STRs density aggregation peaks are mainly composing of a single motif, and AT is the most dominant motif, followed by AATGG and CCATT motifs. And 514 genomic regions were characterized by microsatellite density feature in the full T2T-CHM13 genome. Conclusions: These landscape maps exhibited that microsatellites aggregate in many genomic positions to form a large number of microsatellite density peaks with composing of mainly single motif type in the complete reference genome, indicating that the local microsatellites density varies enormously along the every chromosome of T2T-CHM13. | https://github.com/zhongyangtan/DCM.git, https://github.com/zhongyangtan/GHC.git, https://github.com/zhongyangtan/MDPS.git | 1 | 0\n",

Long-read sequencing allows for the accurate characterisation of TRs, however, the underlying bioinformatics perspectives remain challenging. We present otter and TREAT: otter is a fast targeted local assembler, cross-compatible across different sequencing platforms. It is integrated in TREAT, an end-to-end workflow for TR characterisation, visualisation and analysis across multiple genomes. In a comparison with existing tools based on long-read sequencing data from both Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT, Simplex and Duplex) and PacBio (Sequel 2 and Revio), otter and TREAT achieved state-of-the-art genotyping and motif characterisation accuracy. Applied to clinically relevant TRs, TREAT/otter significantly identified individuals with pathogenic TR expansions. When applied to a case-control setting, we significantly replicated previously reported associations of TRs with Alzheimer9s Disease, including those near or within APOC1 (p=2.63x10-9), SPI1 (p=6.5x10-3) and ABCA7 (p=0.04) genes. We finally used TREAT/otter to systematically evaluate potential biases when genotyping TRs using diverse ONT and PacBio long-read sequencing datasets. We showed that, in rare cases (0.06%), long-read sequencing suffers from coverage drops in TRs, including the disease-associated TRs in ABCA7 and RFC1 genes. Such coverage drops can lead to TR mis-genotyping, hampering the accurate characterisation of TR alleles. Taken together, our tools can accurately genotype TR across different sequencing technologies and with minimal requirements, allowing end-to-end analysis and comparisons of TR in human genomes, with broad applications in research and clinical fields. | https://github.com/human-pangenomics/HPP_Year1_Data_Freeze_v1.0?tab=readme-ov-, https://github.com/holstegelab/treat, https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt/tree/main/repeats, https://github.com/lmdu/pytrf, https://github.com/holstegelab/otter, https://github.com/marbl/CHM13 | 1 | 0\n",

Generating high-fidelity protein pockets areas where proteins interact with ligand molecules, is challenging due to complex interactions between ligand molecules and proteins, flexibility of ligand molecules and amino acid side chains, and complex sequence-structure dependencies. Here, we introduce PocketGen, a deep generative method for generating the residue sequence and the full-atom structure within the protein pocket region that leverages sequence structure consistency. PocketGen consists of a bilevel graph transformer for structural encoding and a sequence refinement module that uses a protein language model (pLM) for sequence prediction. The bilevel graph transformer captures interactions at multiple granularities (atom-level and residue/ligand-level) and aspects (intra-protein and protein-ligand) with bilevel attention mechanisms. For sequence refinement, a structural adapter using cross-attention is integrated into a pLM to ensure structure-sequence consistency. During training, only the adapter is fine-tuned, while the other layers of the pLM remain unchanged. Experiments show that PocketGen can efficiently generate protein pockets with higher binding affinity and validity than state-of-the-art methods. PocketGen is ten times faster than physics-based methods and achieves a 95% success rate (percentage of generated pockets with higher binding affinity than reference pockets) with over 64% amino acid recovery rate. | https://github.com/RosettaCommons/RFdiffusion, https://github.com/zaixizhang/FAIR, https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/dyMEAN, https://github.com/Hoecker-Lab/pocketoptimizer | 1 | 0\n",

But modern implementations with sophisticated models of sequence evolution struggle to resolve deep evolutionary relationships, which can be obscured by excessive sequence divergence and substitution saturation.  Structural phylogenetics has emerged as a promising alternative, because protein structure evolves much more slowly than protein sequences. Recent developments protein in structure prediction using AI have made it possible to predict protein structures for entire protein families, and then to translate these structures into a sequence representation - the 3Di structural alphabet - that can in theory be directly fed into existing sequence based phylogenetic software. To unlock the full potential of this idea, however, requires the inference of a general substitution matrix for structural phylogenetics, which has so far been missing. Here we infer this matrix from large datasets of protein structures and show that it results in a better fit to empirical datasets that previous approaches. We then use this matrix to re-visit the question of the root of the tree of life. Using structural phylogenies of universal paralogs, we provide the first unambiguous evidence for a root between and archaea and bacteria. Finally, we discuss some practical and conceptual limitations of structural phylogenetics.

Accurate, reliable and scalable predictions of  protein-ligand binding affinity across multiple proteins are essential for polypharmacology. Machine learning is a promising tool for multi-target binding affinity  predictions, often formulated as a multi-modal regression problem. Despite  considerable efforts, three challenges remain: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalizations for compounds with new chemical scaffolds, uncertainty quantification  of OOD predictions, and scalability to billions of compounds, which structure-based methods fail to achieve. To address aforementioned challenges, we propose a new model-agnostic anomaly detection-based uncertainty quantification  method, embedding Mahalanobis Outlier Scoring and Anomaly Identification  via Clustering (eMOSAIC). eMOSAIC uniquely quantifies distribution similarities or differences between the multi-modal representation of known cases and  that of a new unseen one.

Determining the existence and precise locations of NLSs experimentally is time-consuming and complicated, resulting in a scarcity of experimentally validated NLS fragments. Consequently, annotated NLS datasets are relatively limited, presenting challenges for data-driven approaches. In this study, we propose an innovative interpretable approach, NLSExplorer, which leverages large-scale protein language models to capture crucial biological information with a novel attention-based deep network for NLS identification. By enhancing the knowledge retrieved from protein language models with a novel attention to key area module, NLSExplorer achieves superior predictive performance compared to existing methods on two NLS benchmark datasets. Additionally, NLSExplorer is able to detect various kinds of segments highly correlated with nuclear transport, such as nuclear export signals. We employ NLSExplorer to investigate potential NLSs and other domains that are important for nuclear transport in nucleus-localized proteins in the Swiss-Prot database.

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool to measure transcriptional bursting and silencing at the individual cell level. In this study, we introduce the single-cell Stochastic Gene Silencing (scSGS) method, which leverages the natural variability in single-cell gene expression to decipher gene function. For a target gene g under investigation, scSGS classifies cells into transcriptionally active (g+) and silenced (g-) samples. It then compares these cell samples to identify differentially expressed genes, referred to as SGS-responsive genes, which are used to infer the function of the target gene g. Analysis of real data demonstrates that scSGS can reveal regulatory relationships up- and downstream of target genes, circumventing the survivorship bias that often affects gene knockout and perturbation studies. scSGS thus offers an efficient approach for gene function prediction, with significant potential to reduce the use of genetically modified animals in gene function research. | https://github.com/Xenon8778/scSGS | 1 | 0\n",

With the growing availability of SO datasets, researchers are eager to extract biological insights from larger datasets for a more comprehensive understanding. However, existing approaches focus on batch effect correction, often neglecting complex biological patterns in tissue slices, complicating feature integration and posing challenges when combining transcriptomics with other omics layers. Here, we introduce \\ours (SpaTial Multi-Slice/omics Analysis), a deep graph contrastive learning model that incorporates graph auto-encoder techniques. \\ours is specifically designed to produce batch-corrected representations while retaining the distinct spatial patterns within each slice, considering both intra- and inter-batch relationships during integration. Extensive evaluations show that \\ours outperforms state-of-the-art methods in distinguishing tissue structures across diverse slices, even when faced with varying experimental protocols and sequencing technologies.

We introduce gRNAde, a geometric RNA design pipeline operating on 3D RNA backbones to design sequences that explicitly account for structure and dynamics. Under the hood, gRNAde is a multi-state Graph Neural Network that generates candidate RNA sequences conditioned on one or more 3D backbone structures where the identities of the bases are unknown. On a single-state fixed backbone re-design benchmark of 14 RNA structures from the PDB identified by Das et al. (2010), gRNAde obtains higher native sequence recovery rates (56% on average) compared to Rosetta (45% on average), taking under a second to produce designs compared to the reported hours for Rosetta. We further demonstrate the utility of gRNAde on a new benchmark of multi-state design for structurally flexible RNAs, as well as zero-shot ranking of mutational fitness landscapes in a retrospective analysis of a recent ribozyme.

These forces predominantly arise from contractility of the actomyosin cortex, allowing for cortical tension, protrusion formation, and cell division. Image-based force inference can derive such forces from microscopy images, without complicated and time-consuming experimental set-ups. However, current methods do not account for common effects, such as physical confinement and local force generation. Here we propose a force-inference method based on a biophysical model of cell shape, and assess relative cellular surface tension, adhesive tension between cells, as well as cytokinesis and protrusion formation. We applied our method on fluorescent microscopy images of the early C. elegans embryo. Predictions for cell surface tension at the 7-cell stage were validated by measurements using cortical laser ablation. Our non-invasive method facilitates the accurate tracking of force generation, and offers many new perspectives for studying morphogenesis.Availability:The data and code needed to recreate the results are freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10223738.

Hummingbirds, in particular, are ideal subjects to test a method for this estimation due to their fast wing motions and unique aerodynamics, which results from their ecological diversification, adaptation to high-altitude environments, and sexually selected displays. Traditionally, wingbeat frequency measurements have been done via \"manual\" image/sound processing. In this study, we present an automated method to detect, track, classify, and monitor hummingbirds in high-speed video footage, accurately estimating their wingbeat frequency using computer vision techniques and signal analysis. Our approach utilizes a zero-shot learning algorithm that eliminates the need for labeling during training. Results demonstrate that our method can produce automated wingbeat frequency estimations with minimal supervision, closely matching those performed by trained human observers. This comparison indicates that our method can, in some scenarios, achieve low or zero error compared to a human, making it a valuable tool for flight analysis.

Cell clustering has been long established in the analysis of scRNA-seq data to identify the groups of cells with similar expression profiles. However, cell clustering is technically challenging, as raw scRNA-seq data have various analytical issues, including high dimensionality and dropout values. Existing research has developed deep learning models, such as graph machine learning models and contrastive learning-based models, for cell clustering using scRNA-seq data and has summarized the unsupervised learning of cell clustering into a human-interpretable format. While advances in cell clustering have been profound, we are no closer to finding a simple yet effective framework for learning high-quality representations necessary for robust clustering. In this study, we propose scSimGCL, a novel framework based on the graph contrastive learning paradigm for self-supervised pretraining of graph neural networks. This framework facilitates the generation of high-quality representations crucial for cell clustering. Our scSimGCL incorporates cell-cell graph structure and contrastive learning to enhance the performance of cell clustering. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets suggest the superiority of the proposed scSimGCL. Moreover, clustering assignment analysis confirms the general applicability of scSimGCL, including state-of-the-art clustering algorithms.

Here, we analyze the potential of AlphaFold3 for correct reproduction of amyloid structures, which are an example of multimeric proteins with low representation in protein structure databases, which may also be characterized by polymorphism. We show that AlphaFold3 is capable of producing amyloid-like assemblies that have significant similarity to experimental structures (TM-score>0.5), although its results are impacted by the number of monomers forming the predicted fibril and a protein of choice. AlphaFold3 produces structurally diverse models of some amyloid proteins, which could reflect their polymorphism observed in nature. We hypothesize that the lower emphasis on multiple sequence analysis (MSA) in AlphaFold3 improves the results quality, since for this class of proteins sequence homology may be misleading in their structural similarity. However, the structural landscape obtained from the modeling does not reflect the real one governed by thermodynamics. Finally, AlphaFold3 enables for the first time, structural modeling of fibril-like structures to a certain extent, possibly including their polymorphic nature.

This study explores the in vitro potential of Malvidin and Echioidinin as probable antileishmanial agents against Leishmania amazonensis, L. braziliensis, and L. infantum, comparing their efficacy to Amphotericin B (AmpB), a standard drug. Malvidin was more potent than Echioidinin across all parasite stages and species. For L. amazonenses, Malvidin9s inhibitory concentration (IC50) values were 197.71±17.20 μM and 258.07±17 μM (stationary and axenic amastigotes, respectively); whereas Echioidinin revealed IC50 values of 272.99±29.90 μM and 335.96±19.35 μM (stationary and axenic amastigotes, respectively). AmpB showed IC50 values of 0.06±0.01 μM and 0.10±0.03 μM, respectively. Malvidin demonstrated lower cytotoxicity activity in mammalian cells with a cytotoxic concentration (CC50) value of 2.920.31±80.29 μM, while AmpB9s showed a value of 1.06±0.12 μM. Malvidin also exhibited favorable selectivity index (SI) values. Malvidin reduced infection rates by up to 35.75% in L. amazonensis-infected macrophages. In silico analysis uncovered strong binding interactions between Malvidin and enzyme arginase in the three species, with key residues such as HIS139 and PRO258 playing a crucial role. Tissue-specific markers expression analysis highlighted the potential Malvidin9s modulation of genes involved in oxidative stress and DNA repair, including glyoxalase 1 (GLO1) and apurinic/apyrimidinic endodeoxyribonuclease 1 (APEX1).

Here, we show that MMRd tumours harbour long-deletion signatures (≥2-5+ base pairs deleted in repetitive regions), which provide new insights into MSI evolution and enable sensitive MSI detection particularly in challenging clinical samples. Long deletions, accumulated through stepwise DNA slippage errors, are significantly more prevalent in metastatic MMRd tumours compared to primary tumours. Importantly, we show that long-deletion signatures harbour features that are distinct from background noise, making them robustly detectable even in shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS, ~0.1X coverage) of formalin-fixed samples. We constructed a machine learning classifier that uses these distinct features to detect Microsatellite Instability in LOw-quality (MILO) samples. MILO achieved 100% accuracy in detecting MSI in sWGS data with only 2%-15% tumour purity and demonstrated promise in identifying MMRd clones in precancerous intestinal lesions.

We introduce a novel methodology introducing the RYmer index, a variant of the commonly-used minimizer index which represents purines (A,G) and pyrimidines (C,T) as R and Y respectively. This creates an indexing scheme robust to the aforementioned chemical damage. We implemented SAFARI, an ancient DNA damage-aware version of the pangenome aligner vg giraffe which uses RYmers to rescue alignments containing deaminated seeds. We show that our approach produces more correct alignments from ancient DNA sequences than current approaches while maintaining a tolerable rate of spurious alignments. In addition, we demonstrate that our algorithm improves the estimate of the rate of ancient DNA damage, especially for highly damaged samples. Crucially, we show that this improved alignment can directly translate into better insights gained from the data by showcasing its integration with a number of extant pangenome tools. | https://github.com/grenaud/SAFARI, https://gist.github.com/badboy/6267743 | 1 | 0\n",

Because  they  introduce less  biases,  pangenomes,  represented  as  graphs,  tend to supplant the usual linear representation of a reference genome, augmented with variations. However, this major change requires new tools adapted to this data  structure.  Among the numerous  questions  that  can  be  addressed  to  a pangenome graph is the search for conserved or divergent genes.

This study integrated single-cell sequencing data and spatial transcriptome data from mouse heart tissue at different time points post-myocardial infarction (MI), and identified four transcriptionally distinct subtypes of lymphatic endothelial cells(LECs) and localized them in space. Interestingly, LECs subgroups was found to be localized in different zones of infarcted heart related to different functions. Additionally, LEC capillary III(LEC ca III) may be involved in the direct regulation of myocardial injuries in infarcted zone from the perspective of metabolic stress, while LEC ca II may be related to the rapid immune inflammatory responses of the border zone in the early stage of MI. LEC ca I, as well as LEC collection mainly participate in the regulation of myocardial tissue edema resolution in the middle and late stages post-MI. Cell trajectory and Cell-Chat analyses further identified that LECs may regulate myocardial edema through Aqp1, and might affect the infiltration of macrophages through the galectin9-CD44 pathway. Collectively, our study revealed the dynamic transcriptional heterogeneity distribution of LECs in different regions of the infarcted heart, in detail; these LECs formed different functional subgroups, that might exhibit different bioeffects in myocardial tissue post-MI. | None | 2 | 0\n",

Protein specific pretraining models have been used to extract latent representations from protein sequences containing structural, functional, and homologous information. However, there is still room for improvement in pre-training models for antibody sequences. On the one hand, existing protein pre-training models primarily utilize pre-training language models without fully considering the differences between protein sequences and language sequences.

We introduce MELISSA, a statistical framework for analyzing Integration Site (IS) data to assess insertional mutagenesis risk. MELISSA employs regression models to estimate and compare gene-specific integration rates and their impact on clone fitness. We tested MELISSA under three settings. First, we conducted extensive simulation studies to verify its performance under controlled conditions. Second, we characterized the IS profile of a lentiviral vector on Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) and compared it with that of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cells (HSPCs), in addition to comparing the in vitro clonal dynamics of MSCs isolated from alternative tissues. Finally, we applied MELISSA to published IS data from patients enrolled in gene therapy clinical trials, successfully identifying both known and novel genes that drive changes in clone growth through vector integration. MELISSA identifies over- and under-targeted genes, estimates IS impact, analyzes differential targeting, and explores biological relevance through pathway analysis. This offers a quantitative tool for researchers, clinicians, and regulators to bridge the gap between IS data and safety and efficacy evaluation, facilitating the generation of comprehensive data packages supporting Investigational New Drug (IND) and Biologics License (BLA) applications, and the development of safe and effective gene and cell therapies. | https://github.com/PellinLab/Melissa | 1 | 0\n",

Our study introduces a novel approach to this field, aiming to expand the search space for new therapeutic agents. We introduce PDGrapher, a causally-inspired graph neural network (GNN) designed to predict combinatorial perturbagens - sets of therapeutic targets - capable of reversing disease effects. Unlike methods that learn responses to perturbations, PDGrapher solves the inverse problem, which is to infer the perturbagens necessary to achieve a specific response - i.e., directly predicting perturbagens by learning which perturbations elicit a desired response. By encoding gene regulatory networks or protein-protein interactions, PDGrapher can predict unseen chemical or genetic perturbagens, aiding in the discovery of novel drugs or therapeutic targets. Experiments across nine cell lines with chemical perturbations show that PDGrapher successfully predicted effective perturbagens in up to 13.33% additional test samples and ranked therapeutic targets up to 35% higher than the competing methods, and the method shows competitive performance across ten genetic perturbation datasets. A key innovation of PDGrapher is its direct prediction capability, which contrasts with the indirect, computationally intensive models traditionally used in phenotype-driven drug discovery that only predict changes in phenotypes due to perturbations. The direct approach enables PDGrapher to train up to 25 times faster than methods like scGEN and CellOT, representing a considerable leap in efficiency. Our results suggest that PDGrapher can advance phenotype-driven drug discovery, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to identifying therapeutically useful perturbations. | https://github.com/mim, https://github.com/theislab/chemCPA, https://github.com/snap-stanford/GEARS, https://github.com/baryshnikova-lab/safepy, https://github.com/bunnech/cellot | 1 | 0\n",

In this study, we aim to uncover metabolites with significant predictive value by analyzing targeted metabolomics data through ML models and XAI methodologies. After robust quality control procedures, we analyzed 55 metabolites from 124 plasma samples, including 53 HF patients and 71 controls, comparing Logistic Regression (Logit) models with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), all achieving high accuracy in predicting group labels: 84.20% (sigma=5.46), 85.73% (sigma=6.25), and 84.80% (sigma=7.84), respectively.

Currently, a variety of miRNA target prediction tools are available, which analyze sequence complementarity, thermodynamic stability, and evolutionary conservation to predict miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) within the 39 untranslated region (39UTR). We propose a concept for further screening sequence-based predicted MTIs by considering the disease similarity between miRNA and gene to establish a prediction database of disease-specific MTIs. We fine-tuned a Sentence-BERT model to calculate disease semantic similarity. The method achieved an F1 score of 0.88 in accurately distinguishing protein-level experimentally (Western Blot, Reporter Assay, etc.) validated MTIs and predicted MTIs.

Within green plants, the derived condition of heterosporous reproduction has emerged from the ancestral condition of homospory in disparate locations on the phylogenetic tree at least 11 times, of which 3 lineages are extant. In all green plant lineages where heterospory has emerged, there has been a significant downsizing in chromosome numbers (refer to figure 1). This dynamic has been investigated without clear answers for many decades. In this study, we combine known ideas from existing literature with novel methods, tools, and data to generate fresh insights into an old question. Using gene family evolution models and selection analyses, we identified gene families that have undergone significant expansion, contraction, or selection in heterosporous lineages. Our results reveal both shared and lineage-specific genomic changes associated with the evolution of heterospory. We found expansions in gene families related to developmental regulation, signaling pathways, and stress responses across heterosporous groups. Notably, the MATE efflux family showed consistent expansion and evidence of selection in heterosporous lineages, suggesting a potentially conserved role in heterospory evolution. These findings highlight novel insights that may underpin the association between heterospory and reduced chromosome numbers. The general importance of chromosome numbers, structure, and sizes in cellular biology notwithstanding, the association between the emergence of heterosporous reproduction and chromosome number reduction/genome downsizing is not fully understood. It remains unclear why there exists a dynamic between aspects of biology at such disparate levels as reproductive life-cycles and chromosome numbers/genome size. Exploring and answering this conundrum of evolutionary biology can add to our broader understanding of life sciences and of biology at different levels.

We mapped vTRs genome-wide binding profiles and identified their potential human targets, which were enriched in immune-mediated pathways, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancers. Through vTR DNA-binding preference analysis, 283 virus-specific and human-like motifs were identified.

We found that simple co-evolutionary and co-expression metrics are highly informative of direct interactions and stable complexes. We used this information to train supervised binary classifiers to predict interactions either directly involved in the formation of a complex (as annotated in IntAct) or forming stable complexes (from Complex Portal). In the former task, our model was able to discriminate direct interactions with an AUROC=0.813, while in the latter it discriminated interaction forming stable complexes with an AUROC=0.964. In both cases, our approach outperformed String, that we employed as a baseline. Feature importance analysis revealed different contributions to the prediction of these distinct interaction types. Co-evolutionary features, in particular those referred to protein domains involved in interaction interfaces, are more important to discriminate direct interactions. On the other hand, co-expression features contributed more to the prediction of stable complexes. From these pairwise predictions we generated a proteome-wide network that we clustered to assess the recovery of known complexes from Complex Portal within network communities. We were able to recover known complexes at a higher accuracy compared to other approaches. In conclusion, we propose a new method able to discriminate direct interactions as well as forming stable complexes.

Although numerous computational techniques have been developed to identify protein binding sites, serving as a valuable screening tool that reduces the time and cost associated with conventional experimental approaches, achieving significant improvements in prediction accuracy remains a formidable challenge. Recent advancements in protein structure prediction, notably through tools like AlphaFold, have made vast numbers of 3-D protein structures available, presenting an opportunity to enhance binding site prediction methods. The availability of detailed 3-D structures has led to the development of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which can analyze complex spatial relationships in protein structures while maintaining invariance to rotations and translations. However, current equivariant GNN methods still face limitations in fully exploiting the geometric features of protein structures. To address this, we introduce E(Q)AGNN-PPIS, an Equivariant Attention- Enhanced Graph Neural Network designed for predicting protein binding sites by leveraging 3-D protein structure. Our method augments the Equivariant GNN framework by integrating an attention mechanism. This attention component allows the model to focus on the most relevant structural features for binding site prediction, significantly enhancing its ability to capture complex spatial patterns and interactions within the protein structure.

Compared with existing methods, MetaDICT can better avoid the overcorrection of batch effects and preserve biological variation when there exist unobserved confounding variables or data sets are highly heterogeneous across studies. Furthermore, MetaDICT can generate comparable embedding at both taxa and sample levels that can be used to unravel the hidden structure of the integrated data and improve the integrative analysis. Applications to synthetic and real microbiome data sets demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of MetaDICT in integrative analysis.

Previously, we introduced our BayesAge frameworks for accurate age prediction through the use of locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) to capture the non-linear relationship between methylation or gene expression and age, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for bulk bisulfite and RNA sequencing data. Here we now introduce MicroBayesAge, a framework that enhances prediction accuracy by subdividing input data into age-specific cohorts and employing a new two-stage process for training and testing. Age prediction for younger patients was significantly improved. MicroBayesAge also exhibited minimal bias in its age predictions. Additionally, we explored the performance of our model for sex-specific age prediction which revealed slight improvements in accuracy for male patients, while no changes were observed for female patients. MicroBayesAge provides more accurate age predictions by accounting for variations in epigenetic markers of aging among different subgroups, which have been overlooked by commonly used models. | https://github.com/nicolecnolan/MicroBayesAge | 1 | 0\n"
